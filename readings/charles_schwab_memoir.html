</h1>
            <ul>
            <li>What are you good at, what do you love doing, what can you talk about without even thinking about it and without tiring of it? I ask them. That’s where you should put your energy. There is tremendous power in that because it drives you forward through the ups and downs—and there will always be plenty of both. That passion and knowledge also signal to others that you are genuine, with personal ambitions, true expertise, a direction in life—the real deal. People are attracted to that, and you will need the support of others.</li><li>The world of business, like the rest of life, is full of wonderful temptations, and making a choice about where you are going to devote your energy is often as much about dismissing things as it is about choosing something. A singular sense of purpose gives you focus and clarity. Determine that direction but know that it is not the end; it can flower and branch out in many ways over time, some that you’d never guess when starting out. In my case, I loved investing—everything about it: the idea that companies are meant to grow, that anyone can participate in that growth and build up their own financial independence over time. Feeling that passion and then learning that most people were missing out because the system wasn’t designed to serve the average investor…well, that became an endless opportunity and a powerful cause that others would embrace with me!</li><li>Who starts a brokerage firm in the middle of a two-decade stock market slump? This was my third go at starting a business since I had set out on my own, shortly after finishing Stanford Business School. Part of me wondered, How many chances does one guy get in life?</li><li>“Wait until Merrill Lynch decides to go into your business. You are going to be crushed.” I was worried, but Merrill was an entrenched member of the Wall Street establishment. It was still beholden to its many commissioned brokers, and its highly profitable investment banking and research businesses. It couldn’t just chuck all that out the window. Still, the more I thought about it, the more I was certain that Merrill would have to lower its commissions at least a little in response to deregulation. In which case, I feared, I’d be dead in the water as soon as I launched my business. No way my little firm could compete with an industry giant like Merrill.</li><li>Today, I remain more convinced than ever that investing is the individual’s path to financial freedom. It is how people can participate in a growing economy, beyond just earning a paycheck. I’m an optimist. And investing has always seemed to me to be the ultimate act of optimism. You’ve got to have confidence that the money you invest today is going to grow; otherwise, you might as well stuff it under the mattress. You have to believe tomorrow will be better than today.</li><li>I thought if I could strip away all the fluff surrounding the purchase and sale of stocks—the tainted research, the bogus analysis, the flimsy recommendations, all the ways that Wall Street had historically justified high commissions—and sell just the plain-vanilla service of executing trades, I could slash overhead, focus on efficiency, cut prices dramatically—by as much as 75%—and still make a profit.</li><li>Trying to build a life in the wake of the Depression had an enormous impact on my parents’ attitudes toward money, saving, and risk that lasted their entire lives. No matter how comfortable they became, they always talked about the hard times when they were young. They’d seen people lose their homes and their independence, and they weren’t ever going to let that happen to them. There was always that shadow that hung over their lives.</li><li>My own attitudes about financial security and personal independence were a reaction against that Depression mentality. I grew to hate the whole idea of limits and decided early on that I did not want to live like that, ever again. I wanted to be above such worries, to be truly financially independent. Consequently, I was always thinking about how I could make money, how I could save money, and later, how I could invest it.</li><li>I was shy, but my confidence and curiosity had a way of beating the shyness. I’m sure one of the reasons for my success over the years has been that people generally like me—and the secret to that is just human nature: I pay attention to them. I listen to their stories and take a genuine interest. And it’s made for a richer life. People are endlessly fascinating and their stories are motivating. I also think listening compensated for difficulties I had with reading. It was a great way for me to absorb new things. Overcoming shyness and mastering people skills has been one of the keys to success for me, and I owe a lot to my mom for reinforcing that when I was growing up. It’s a perfect complement to the inner discipline my father encouraged.</li><li>make a choice and don’t regret it, don’t look back.</li><li>To this day I believe there are great parallels between golf and investing. Both require preparation, patience, practice, and a long-term commitment. Both require strategy. You need to think several steps ahead. What’s the lay of the land? How do you control your emotions? Both are full of highs and lows.</li><li>I SUPPOSE I’VE ALWAYS been a relatively confident person. Or at least it is a quality I developed over time, without even realizing it was happening. A lot of it was just having the willingness to put myself out there and try things. Some people are born leaders, I guess, but for most of us the ability to lead comes from experience. The more you lead, the more it develops as a strength. I just dove in when I saw a void, putting myself in situations where I had to speak up.</li><li>To this day I encourage young executives to get training in public speaking. No matter how good they are, mastering those moments in front of an audience is crucial to leading others, and it rarely comes naturally.</li><li>With the stock market, there are no guarantees. You can guarantee service, costs, quality, and certainly integrity. But you can’t guarantee performance. Risk is just part of the deal.</li><li>I wanted to be out on my own, building something that was mine. This was the early 1960s. Most young men my age who were entering the workforce still believed that the surest path to success in life was latching on to a reputable firm and working their way up through the ranks. They expected to stay with one company their whole careers.</li><li>Lucky for me, I never wanted to be a cog in somebody else’s organizational wheel. I had worked at a bank one summer while I was still in school and had met people who had worked there for 20 or 30 years, and I knew I wanted no part of that life.</li><li>The closest I came to anything like that was when I briefly considered becoming a CPA. I had the right academic background, and I even interviewed at a couple of firms. But I figured if I went that route, I’d be working for at least two years as a young accountant before I could take the CPA exam. Years would pass before becoming a partner. At that point in my life, that just seemed like a terrible waste of a life. Frankly, I couldn’t afford to wait around for decades for a shot at a decent salary.</li><li>And I knew that my best shot at accumulating wealth—the kind of wealth that would ensure my independence—lay with starting my own company. Experiencing how powerful and motivating that sense of ownership is, I’ve always encouraged and helped my employees over the years to be owners in our company as well.</li><li>Maybe it’s possible to be as focused as I was on building a business while still preserving a happy marriage and family life, but I know from my own experience that it is very hard to do. And especially during a particularly tough time in the investment business, as the market had been in a slump since 1966.</li><li>Helen was a lot smarter than me. (Which by the way is my advice to my sons: marry someone who’s smarter than you!)</li><li>We didn’t want advice from brokers, because we knew that advice was tainted. How could a broker truly have my best interests at heart when his livelihood depended on generating commissions? And we resented paying for services we had no use for.</li><li>It’s just that the compensation structure itself, driven by commissions, worked against the customer’s interests. On the other hand, if you take the brokers out of the equation—as I was proposing to do—how then do you sell stocks? Well, you don’t sell. You market. I was never any good at selling anyway, but if I’d learned anything from all those years of publishing newsletters, it was how to do direct marketing. My big aha! was when I realized I didn’t have to sell at all. All I had to do was market the discount brokerage service and then provide the best possible customer service.</li><li>I knew that if I was going to succeed, it would be as a marketer, not a salesman.</li><li>But recognizing a business opportunity is only one part of succeeding as an entrepreneur. The key is acting on your business insight and following through. How many times have you slapped yourself on the forehead and asked, “Why didn’t I think of that?” Successful entrepreneurs are idea people, to be sure, but more than that they are men and women who feel compelled to act. Otherwise, it’s all talk.</li><li>I think one of the toughest things entrepreneurs have to do is go to friends and family, hat in hand, asking for money. It takes a lot of gumption. But, boy, are you ever motivated then to succeed. You’ll work your butt off, if only to not let them down.</li><li>Companies are built to grow. But it doesn’t come easily. Some succeed, many fail. I believe it is incumbent on every leader of a company that the number one thing on their mind is growth. You don’t prosper without it. You’ve got to inspire your organization to grow like a weed. And each year it has to be better than the last year by 10% to 15% minimum. It’s not easy. Relax? You can’t relax! Satisfied? You can never be satisfied!</li><li>Growth and opportunity are two sides of the same coin. If you are growing, there’s a chance to grab new opportunities. If you’re not always thinking about the next opportunity, the next great thing, your growth will stall, or worse, you’ll be a sitting duck and someone will jump ahead of you with a better idea.</li><li>You simply cannot plan seamlessly for every blip in the market. The art lies in managing your cost structure in such a way that you keep pace with demand without getting too far ahead of yourself. But it is definitely an art, not a science, and there were times (especially in the early days) when we miscalculated.</li><li>Somehow, it always worked out. In the years to come we would tumble into and climb back out of many more precarious situations. But with each one, we got stronger, and smarter.</li><li>It’s very hard to be skeptical and smart when there’s money involved. Everybody wants to believe. But that’s just it. Selling that way exploits human nature by telling people what they want to hear.</li><li>When I started in the business, the goal for brokers was to capture between 3% and 4% of their client’s wealth each year in commissions. Our reps, on the other hand, had but one incentive, and it was perfectly aligned with the client’s. The more the client made and the happier they were with the service they got, the more our employees made, period. We paid a salary and a bonus for client satisfaction—that was it. We didn’t pressure anybody to make trades. We didn’t recommend a stock or mutual fund just to make a sale. We didn’t seduce our clients with questionable claims. We didn’t tell stories. We don’t today.</li><li>Then again, as I discovered very early on, being the company that does not tell sales stories can be the starting point for a terrific marketing story, a way of thinking about who we are and the services we provide that leaves no doubt in the minds of customers and employees alike about what sets us apart. How do you get that message across? Not the way brokers have traditionally gone after clients, by cold-calling. Maybe you can sell stocks to unsuspecting buyers over the phone, but you’re not going to sell a stock-buying service that way. From the start, I had to depend on advertising, direct response marketing, and public relations.</li><li>To this day I remind my marketing team that we built Schwab on public relations and third-party endorsements.</li><li>The photograph is what made the ad work. For one thing, it made us easy to spot; the Journal didn’t print photographs with its news stories in those days, so the photo stood out. And my picture was a signal to the reader that we were a different kind of brokerage company. Others offered a personal relationship with a broker; we offered readers one with the CEO of the firm.</li><li>You try a lot of things as an entrepreneur. You learn as you go. And sometimes you wind up with something that works that wasn’t planned.</li><li>spent time with Bert Decker, a San Francisco public speaking consultant. One thing he told me that I never forgot: “Audiences don’t remember information, they remember the man.”</li><li>And that no one knows the content or the order of your presentation, so don’t worry about forgetting something. In the end, I learned to speak from notes, rather than a script. Once I was free to say what I wanted, in my own words, I could relax. I think people recognized my sincerity. I wasn’t glib, and I obviously was not a salesman. And in the end, all that worked to our advantage.</li><li>Sometimes a bright idea with a bad outcome is the one that gets you back on track toward the right one.</li><li>“Being big is important,” I said. “But not big for big’s sake, but because it enables you to invest and improve the services you provide.” Being big meant expanding revenue to reinvest and improve; that required growth.</li><li>My competitors weren’t doing much of anything with branches. Les Quick, of Quick & Reilly, resisted the concept for years, and I know why. It took roughly four years on average for a branch to become profitable. Opening branches is expensive, it eats into profits. But not forever—that’s the key. So while Les was building a $50 million company with 25% pretax profits and bragging rights to being the most profitable discount brokerage in America, I was content to be America’s largest discount brokerage and growing. In the end, Les built a perfectly fine small company and made millions for himself when he sold it. Nothing wrong in that. But I built a company that size many times over, while building greater value for clients and shareholders along the way.</li><li>Gamblers like taking risks, not entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs start with a vision and accept, reluctantly, that no vision was ever realized without risking something important. But a true entrepreneur seeks to control his risks as much as possible.</li><li>What was most astonishing to me was that all our growth had occurred during a period of high inflation, double-digit interest rates, and lackluster stock market returns. Clearly, we were in the midst of what analysts call a secular, or long-term, shift in the way ordinary Americans thought about investing.</li><li>It’s an irony: growth is a sign of success and shows you’re on to something that people want, but with a young company like ours the growth outpaces your sources of capital. You’re reinvesting every penny of profit you can, and it’s not enough.</li><li>Nobody anywhere in financial services—much less in the stodgy world of banking—could match our level of computerized automation; no one came closer to the ideal of a paperless office. Clearly, that was a big part of what made us so attractive to Bank of America: our technological edge. But it was not just our computers; it was our vitality, our spirit of innovation—in marketing as much as technology—that impressed Bank of America.</li><li>My greatest fear was that we’d be straitjacketed by the BofA bureaucracy and lose our souls. Rich Arnold, who negotiated the fine print along with our lawyer, Larry Rabkin, had an expression that covered that whole universe of concerns. He used to talk about “the couch department,” as in he was going to make damn sure no bureaucrat from the BofA couch department ever tried to tell us how we could furnish our offices.</li><li>I had made a commitment months before, knowing full well that markets are volatile and that a lot could change. They had my word and I had every intention of abiding by it.</li><li>I believed in the power of equity. I still do today. I think having a substantial stake in the success or failure of the enterprise makes you a more involved director, a more effective manager, a more motivated employee. And it troubled me from day one, as I looked around the boardroom at my fellow directors, to know that my fate was linked with the bank’s to a degree that theirs was not. I would have felt better if everybody there owned more stock, not less.</li><li>Also in 1982, Congress passed and President Reagan signed legislation simplifying the rules and expanding eligibility for Individual Retirement Accounts. Suddenly every American under age 70 who had a job could make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA. IRA contributions took a huge leap forward from just under $5 billion in 1981 to more than $28 billion in 1982. With the bull raging, a lot of that money found its way into the stock market, sending prices higher still. It was the beginning of an important shift in the way Americans think about their money, with huge implications for the health of Schwab, and we took full advantage of it to strengthen our company.</li><li>Then came the avalanche at tax time. Fidelity made that easier for investors with their wide range of choices—you could easily use them as a one-stop way to shop and manage your funds. I knew we needed a way into this market, but it wasn’t going to be by competing head-to-head building and marketing our own funds. Instead, we figured, why not be a one-stop shopping place for other company’s funds, with a focus on convenience.<br />[Context: Context: Fidelity was going towards market dominance by being the major player in mutual funds. While Schwab didn’t like that (since they cater to people who pick their own stocks) they was the trends and wanted in on the action]</li><li>The way I see it, every time we make another advance, we strip away one more layer of intermediation between the masses and the markets. That’s always good. Anything that promotes stock trading and stock ownership, I’m all for it. I’m very proud of the role Schwab has played over the years to advance that cause.</li><li>When you buy stock, you don’t just buy equity in that company; you buy a stake in the system. The more stock, the bigger the stake—and, as I have long argued, the more engaged the citizen.</li><li>After we started our Mutual Fund Marketplace, for example, we wanted to offer our customers fund-performance numbers to help them make smart choices. No advice, mind you, just numbers: information. This was hardly a new concept for us. I’ve always believed that when it comes to investing, the more information, the better. But anything that so much as hinted of “advice” was seen by the regulatory overlords—initially, at least—as beyond the mandate of discount brokerage and therefore not okay.</li><li>I’d just always assumed that even in a worst-case scenario, if I had to start all over again at zero, I’d be okay. I would land on my feet again.</li><li>ON AUGUST 13, 1986, I resigned from the board of Bank of America. Sam Armacost took it as a personal insult, but that’s not at all what I intended. I just had to get out of there—mainly because I had begun plotting how to get my company back and was worried about conflicts of interest; I couldn’t very well negotiate with myself. But also because I was completely frustrated, tense, and unhappy. It was weighing on me. The board’s response surprised me. As obstinate a colleague as I had become, when it came right down to it, no one actually wanted me to quit. Lee Prussia, the chairman, tried to talk me out of it. He was worried how my departure would play at a time when the board was fielding lawsuits from angry shareholders (I wasn’t alone anymore) and denying rumors that the bank was on the verge of collapse. He asked me to think it over. I did, but only for a couple of days. Instead, I honored their request to delay the resignation until month’s end to give them some time to prepare. Few choices I have made in my life have been more agonizing, yet none felt more right in the end. I left town shortly afterward for a week of R&R in Hawaii, and I remember distinctly what a revelation it was—that sense of having escaped from under an immense burden. I felt free like I hadn’t felt free in years.</li><li>There are some areas where I always trust my own knowledge and instincts, and never completely relinquish control; there are others where I’m eager to have help.</li><li>skills. I also knew that while it was critical we not lose Schwab to another buyer, it was just as important not to allow the whole organization to be drawn into the fight.</li><li>“There’s a big difference between stupidity and fraud.” In other words, yes, Bank of America had misrepresented its financial health when it bought us with inflated stock in 1982; that much we knew and could probably prove. But could we prove it had done so intentionally? Much more difficult. And if we failed, we’d certainly have created deep resentment. It would be that much harder to come back and bargain with the enemy. Better to at least begin negotiations on civil terms, that was George’s advice. And after hearing him out, I agreed.</li><li>In retrospect, the fact that we were careful to exclude my name and likeness from the sale to Bank of America made us look like geniuses. Not that anyone could have foreseen the critical role that clause one day played. But thank goodness Larry Rabkin had made sure to include it. Essentially it confirmed that when I sold my company to Bank of America, I would only be licensing the rights to my name and likeness; in the unlikely event Schwab were ever shuttered or sold, such rights reverted to me. Nothing in the agreement prevented Bank of America from one day selling to a third party, as they now threatened to do. But in that case I would be free to cross the street and open Charles Schwab the sequel. The bank could sell my business; it could not sell me or my management team.</li><li>When the stock market falls, it’s usually because interest rates are rising.</li><li>Now that I had my freedom from BofA, I was determined to pay down those loans as quickly as possible. I hated owing so much money. It felt like I was wearing a financial straitjacket. Big bank loans come with all kinds of restrictive covenants: you can only devote this much to capital expenditures; your profits must be such and such; if you want this or that you need to ask us first. I’ve never liked managing my business in the face of such constraints. The marriage to BofA proved that. I need freedom to act quickly, to invest in new products and new markets even if it means sacrificing short-term profits. That makes for a better business in the long term, and it certainly made for a better experience for our clients along the way. There were so many great opportunities ahead that I wanted to go after. And we had strong cash flow to help us be aggressive. The sooner I could pay down the debt and get out from under those covenants, the better.</li><li>You control your decisions and you control how well you execute them; you don’t control the environment.</li><li>Luck is almost never only luck, especially in anything having to do with the stock market or in building a business.</li><li>luck is never enough alone. Insight, reasonable expectations, and experience all contribute and turn luck into opportunity. And most important, being prepared to take advantage of luck when it comes your way; making your own luck whenever you can.</li><li>George as much as anyone understood my discomfort with debt and my impatience to pay it down. “When you can raise some capital, go do it,” was his plain advice. Go pay it down. “Don’t mess around and try to time the market.” My feelings exactly. Don’t push your luck.</li><li>Schwab experienced its own tsunami in 1987. The right combination of factors that set us back on our heels for a moment—a management-led buyout from BofA and the debt that came with it, then going public and the scrutiny that creates, the market crash on October 19 that unleashed a sudden surge of client calls and trades, and our discovery that client margin debt was a bigger risk than we ever anticipated and certainly hadn’t planned for. It all happened fast, forever changing our perspective about risk and how we have managed it since. In the midst of it all, it’s terrifying; all you can do is concentrate on getting through it. With luck you have a little warning and the wherewithal to protect yourself. Everything you know is being tested! But get through it: learn from it, that’s the thing.</li><li>An isolated margin call is one thing, bad for that single client. But when falling prices trigger widespread margin calls, and those in turn trigger more selling, that can lead to a run on the market. It was one of the big threats we saw developing across the industry.</li><li>At 9:30 a.m. Eastern time the markets opened and the wave of selling from around the world hit New York. The New York Stock Exchange opened down 10%. Many big-name firms didn’t start trading for hours as the specialists tried to make sense of the jumble of orders or to find willing buyers for the wave of sellers. It’s hard to imagine it from the perspective of today’s highly digitized world where you simply click and it happens, but in 1987, an investor wanting to buy or sell a stock called his broker; the broker passed along the information to his representative at the exchange; and that person sprinted with it to hand it off to a floor broker, who walked it to the trading station for that particular stock. There the specialist matched a buy and a sell or stepped in himself to trade for his firm if a buyer or seller couldn’t quickly be found. Confirmation of the trade made its way back through the chain and the client was notified. On a normal day that happened in just minutes. That morning, the system limped sluggishly as if it didn’t know what to make of all the demands. Nervous clients called back repeatedly, adding to call volume, “Did my trade go through?”</li><li>I don’t think human nature deals very well with the patience and strong stomach investing requires. We’re wired for fight or flight. Look at a chart of the S&P 500 (see this page) over 40 years and you see an endless series of jagged peaks and valleys. Each one of those downs and ups is a moment of panic or elation. But step back for a wider view and you see the inevitable direction is up. Stick with it and ride out the emotions and you’re an investor.</li><li>There is a central truth about investing: time is on your side when there’s plenty of it; it can be your worst enemy when it’s scarce.</li><li>When you lead an organization, you look at the problem, make your best judgment about what needs to get done, and act.</li><li>I’ve always felt that when you make mistakes, if you stand up and admit them, people will give you the benefit of the doubt.</li><li>But on Black Monday, when volume surged to over 50,000 trades in one day, our speed and responsiveness simply wasn’t good enough. If you’re a growth company like Schwab was, and your objective is to be the best at what you do, you’ve got to be looking further out. Anticipating what’s around the corner. Some customers never forgave us and we lost them forever. We paid the price for years to come in their lost revenue. Worse, to my way of thinking, we had failed in the eyes of those clients. Once lost, trust is hard to regain. Ultimately that experience led us to develop state-of-the-art call centers, which could handle far greater fluctuations in volume, and eventually to pioneer the development of automated systems using touch-tone telephones and the internet. We learned from our shortcomings.</li><li>In May 1988, I testified before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on the need to clamp down on program trading, which I described as “the modern high-tech equivalent of our old nemesis, market manipulation. Pools of capital, moving in concert, utilizing high leverage through options and futures contracts, and very often managed by computer programs—these are the modern-day robber barons.” In many cases, I argued, the money deployed by program traders belongs to Wall Street firms, which “are abdicating their responsibility to the American markets.” Ultimately the exchanges all instituted so-called circuit breakers, which suspend program trading during periods of high market volatility.</li><li>Taking and managing risk is a critical part of any successful endeavor. In business particularly, you have to have an appetite for it or you stagnate and don’t do the things that delight the customers and keep them coming back for more.</li><li>Whatever its source, the jump into the abyss is also never simply a blind leap of faith that puts everything at risk, at least not for me. You’re never gambling the whole house, you take calculated risks. You’ve thought things through, and experience and maturity and intuition and the tests you go through give you incrementally better odds each time. Nineteen eighty-seven was one of those tests.</li><li>Hiring consultants was a bit of a tactical departure for us. I had avoided them so far, because I normally don’t trust ideas divorced from execution, and consultants don’t execute. It’s too easy to make grand conclusions when you don’t have to put them into action. Often the best answer is right there in front of you, if you know your business. My change of heart was an acknowledgment that we weren’t such a young company anymore; we could no longer rely solely on our own hunches, and there was a lot we could learn from others. Still, our expectations were modest.</li><li>“Panic is not a strategy, stick with your investment plan, and don’t let emotions get the better of you.” Heeding that advice when you’re in full panic mode is just not easy. People aren’t wired to be good investors.</li><li>I was always keyed into my own clients. To me, the trick was coming up with products and services that satisfied investor needs before anyone else did. Get out ahead and others would be playing catch-up. If I could succeed at that, then I could safely ignore my competitors.</li><li>The only way that works is if you have solid firsthand knowledge. I got mine by spending a lot of time in the branches—talking to customers, watching what they were doing, trying to understand what they were thinking. And because I created Schwab to be the kind of firm that I would want to do business with, I always paid close attention to my own changing needs and habits as an investor. If I’ve been right more often than not over the years, that’s probably because I’ve always been my own best customer.</li><li>Steve Jobs famously said customers don’t know what they want; you have to show it to them. Any entrepreneur who is out there coming up with new ideas will say something similar. Innovation springs from that internal voice saying this is a great idea, the next big thing. People will love it. Market research and testing can play a role, but they’re no substitute for good gut instincts and simply building something you yourself would love to have.</li><li>I liked index funds in particular: they were smart choices, especially for investors unwilling to devote a lot of time to research. They passed the would-I-buy-it-for-myself? test. Index funds make no attempt to outperform the market—as the index rises and falls, so, too, does the index fund—which turns out to be an excellent strategy for outsmarting most actively managed mutual funds.</li><li>Indexing was cost-effective for investors and relatively straightforward to manage; it scaled easily, it performed in logical and consistent ways, and it made a great centerpiece to an investor’s portfolio. In retrospect, it’s clear that we didn’t push in that direction hard enough and ceded the indexing territory to Vanguard for far too long.</li><li>BCG’s overall conclusions: what we had built at Schwab was a lean, scalable brokerage machine, well tuned to deliver services to independent investors. (“A wonderful, fabulous, efficient factory,” was one of the phrases Leemon used to describe how we operated; also, “The goose that’s laying the golden egg.”) BCG’s recommendation: Don’t kill it. Don’t complicate the cost structure by mimicking full-service brokers. Don’t go after clients who need a broker’s advice. Don’t do anything that might compromise Schwab’s reputation for being fair, independent, trustworthy, consistent, innovative, and a good value. On the other hand, do leverage what’s already in place, including technology and the branch network. Do offer new products and services appropriate to your existing client base. Do ramp up advertising to attract new accounts and build scale.</li><li>But what strikes me most about the list when I look at it now is how many of the steps—4 out of the 10—had to do with strengthening the brand and expanding our appeal with new products and services aimed at our existing customers. Number 7, “Broaden Products,” was probably the most important in that regard. It followed the finding that individual stocks were losing ground relative to other investments, especially mutual funds. We knew that our clients were already big buyers of no-load mutual funds. The challenge we faced was persuading them to consolidate their holdings with us. Our stated goal—pretty ambitious when you consider that all we had at the time was a small collection of money market funds—was to capture 25% of our customers’ fund business.</li><li>The no-load fund universe in those days was basically composed of three giants—Fidelity, Vanguard, and Twentieth Century. Everybody else was made up of hundreds of smaller players fighting for attention in the listings of Money Magazine or Barron’s or the Wall Street Journal. The key challenge for the little guys was distribution. It was a game of advertising, customer service, and distribution, and all that was expensive. But as a fixed cost, advertising, for example, scales quickly. Every time you double sales, your per-unit advertising cost drops by half. Meaning the bigger you are, the better you can afford the costs of distribution. We looked at the numbers, noted that our brokerage revenues already put us in the same league with the giants of the mutual fund industry, and arrived at a conclusion: The little funds are going to be driven out of business by the big ones. With scale, we can distribute more cheaply than they can. So they should be willing to pay us to distribute. From that insight came OneSource, the most successful new business we built in the 1990s. Best of all, we didn’t have to build it from scratch. The structure was already in place. We had tried to sell the marketplace idea on the convenience factor—easy transfers between funds, next-day postings to your Schwab account, all your funds on one monthly statement, less paperwork at tax time; “500 no-load funds, one 800 number,” was the tagline in the ad we ran once a week, buried in the lower left-hand corner of page C2 of the Wall Street Journal. Some people thought it was a valuable service and willingly paid the fees. But frankly, not many. Schwab clients, if nothing else, hated fees. The main reason they had come to us in the first place was to save on commissions. Now here we were saying, You can buy this Janus fund through Schwab and pay us $70, or you can pick up the phone and call Janus and buy the same fund for free. Most chose the latter, and I didn’t blame them. We had created the highest-priced no-load funds. Being the most expensive place to buy no-load mutual funds was not a good market position for us, which is why I never promoted Mutual Fund Marketplace beyond that one little ad in the Wall Street Journal. I felt it muddied our message.</li><li>Was it possible we were at an inflection point in the mutual fund business? Could we get fund companies to pay us so we could eliminate transaction fees and this marketplace idea would take off? John thought maybe that day was near, and if so, it was a once-in-a-lifetime game changer. The potential was huge for us and for investors. He pleaded to work on that. David Pottruck interceded on his behalf (“I’ll make sure Larry doesn’t get too mad”), and John, with David’s guidance, turned to the task. John and his team encountered skepticism at every turn, and that was before we even thought about trying to sell fund companies on the idea. We knew going in that the margins would be thin—25 to 35 cents for every 100 dollars invested. “Let me get this straight,” Larry challenged John. “We have this nice little business (Mutual Fund Marketplace) selling no-load funds to our clients. And they pay us a transaction fee. We put transaction fees in the numerator and assets in the denominator to see how much we’re earning as a percentage of assets. Works out to about 0.60%. So you’re saying we should trade in a 0.60% business for a 0.25% business and you’re going to make it up on volume?” Well, yes, that’s what John was saying. Larry was right to be concerned.</li><li>For most of the meeting, I listened. My role was to embrace risk when I saw an opportunity for a huge reward. I’ve always tried to encourage my operating people to make big leaps that could have a significant impact on the company’s bottom line.</li><li>Whenever such opportunities arise, my instinct is to leap now, before anyone else does.</li><li>How do we brag about a benefit most people haven’t thought to ask for yet?</li><li>And while we’re at it, we’ve got two other big and important things we’ve got to do. We have to build a system to track how long the funds are held in clients’ accounts so we can charge the market timers a fee, and we need a system to bill the fund companies.” Again, market timers were investors that jumped in and out of a fund quickly depending on what the market was doing, hoping to profit from short-term market movements. The funds didn’t like them. The quick in and out created tax issues for other shareholders and a host of management headaches in what were designed to be longer-term investments. “We’ll also need time to persuade the fund companies that this concept of no-load funds writing checks to brokers doesn’t violate existing regulations,” John reminded us. “If you’re giving us the thumbs-up sign, great, we’re ready to get going. But we’ve got a lot of work to do. It’s going to take us a while.”</li><li>ONESOURCE WAS NOURISHED IN one unexpected way, by Schwab’s growing network of independent financial advisers. We fondly called it our accidental success.</li><li>That network was not something we set out to create. In fact, it may be the only business ever jump-started by a compliance officer. One day in 1985, Guy Bryant, our chief compliance officer, walked into Tom Seip’s office and dropped a computer printout two inches thick on Tom’s desk. “This printout represents people who have powers of attorney over a number of brokerage accounts,” Guy said. “So what?” said Tom. Guy explained that he had to review the form from time to time as part of his compliance duties. And what he expected to find were guys who had power of attorney over a bunch of family accounts. That’s pretty common, running money for parents or siblings or children. But here we had people who didn’t appear to be related, spread all over the country. He showed the paperwork for a guy who had 300 different accounts that he had power of attorney over. He needed to find out what was going on. Well, we started calling all these guys and lo and behold, we stumbled upon an embryonic industry. They were like brokers, offering advice, placing orders, and handling record-keeping for their clients. Except instead of getting paid by commission, they charged an annual fee based on a percentage of their clients’ assets. The more money they made for their clients, the more they got paid. Turns out an awful lot of them were executing their clients’ trades through us rather than Dean Witter or Merrill Lynch because they liked our service. Plus they didn’t have to worry about us trying to steal their accounts. Tom</li><li>The mutual fund supermarket had arrived. Power no longer resided with the manufacturers—that is, the fund managers. It had shifted to the distributors—our OneSource, Fidelity’s FundsNetwork, and to a lesser extent the other fund supermarkets that followed. “Investment management becomes the commodity,” is how Biggs described the new reality to Fortune, “and the proprietary asset is the ability to distribute.”</li><li>As founder, I was part visionary, part exhorter. David conveyed the company’s vision to the troops with great passion. Larry executed. Larry was my only direct report, and that’s how I liked it. If you have too many people reporting to you, then you have to worry about competing interpretations of your intent. With just one, you can be very broad in your exhortations, even vague, but only if you trust the person beneath you the way I trusted Larry.</li><li>One of my strengths as a leader is my willingness to surround myself with people who are smarter than I am, or at least have skills that I don’t; one of my weaknesses is a tendency to avoid confrontation. Both my strengths and my weaknesses were on display as Larry and David fought hard for the unofficial title of Chuck’s Favorite Son. How was I going to figure this out without losing one or the other? I wanted them both. They each had great attributes. The whole thing was becoming a major distraction. As founder, these were decisions I had to make all by myself. As CEO, there really was nobody I could talk to about such things. I’m sure neither of them was happy.</li><li>And there was our push into Individual Retirement Accounts, or IRAs. It was one of those examples of turning old assumptions on their head and seeing the competitive landscape change as a result.</li><li>OneSource was due to hit in June, and rollover IRAs were starting to become a big factor—there were a lot of assets in play. Suddenly Lyons thought, Why not take the annual fee off the IRA account? Make it free. I loved his idea! We had a $22 fee for IRAs. Such fees were standard in the industry. Getting rid of ours now would be painful, not unlike eliminating the transaction fee on mutual fund trades for OneSource. But Lyons saw an opportunity to try something bold, break away from the pack, gain some notoriety, and with luck, open the gates to a flood of new accounts. If it worked the way he thought it would, the growth in assets would more than make up for the loss of annual fees.</li><li>David was immediately enthusiastic, but wary. He worried about losing so much fee income at precisely the time of year when those fees start rolling in. He calculated the cost at $9 million. Not a huge number in a year in which our revenues would exceed $900 million; but that was $9 million that would otherwise drop straight to the bottom line. So David argued for a threshold of $25,000 in IRA assets. Above that, your account is free. Less, we still charge. My first thought when David and Jeff brought me the proposal was, why bother with thresholds at all? Why not just make it free for everybody? Here was another one of those ideas that made immediate sense to me as an investor: I knew I would open an IRA at Schwab if Schwab was the only firm that didn’t charge me a fee. I didn’t care about losing income in the short term. What was $9 million against an opportunity to acquire new accounts and build our asset base?</li><li>Looking strictly at the revenue generated by new IRA accounts, we made up for the loss of fees in less than one year. It was another example in a long line that proved how motivating lower costs can be.</li><li>A simple but important truism: all else being equal, price matters.</li><li>What I did know was that competing solely on price was becoming an increasingly dicey proposition. The fact is, we had never been the least expensive option, even in the early days. As an investor myself, I had always been willing to pay a little extra for better service. That was one of the principles on which I had built the firm, and if anything, that principle was becoming more important to us, not less. The effect of all the new products and services we introduced in the early 1990s was not simply a more diverse revenue stream; it was also a more diverse customer base.</li><li>Technology for me is a means to an end. I get excited about some new gadget or software when I can see how it might foster a deeper, faster, more direct connection between my company and my customers, or between my customers and the market.</li><li>(Like lots of Schwab’s early brands, Equalizer was meant to send a clear message: the client’s access was now “equal” to the pro’s.)</li><li>Everything the internet promised—24-hour access, full transparency, abundant (and ultimately free) news and research—was anathema to the business model of the old-line wire houses and their self-assigned role as market gatekeepers.</li><li>I have never believed in waiting around for perfection.</li><li>Innovators should expect failure, it’s part of the process. As head of the organization, it was my job to encourage experimentation, not punish failure. Each time we failed we learned something and so resumed growing from a higher base.</li><li>Thankfully, nothing ever came of the proposed Microsoft-Intuit merger; the threat of a Justice Department antitrust action stopped it. In the end, Microsoft failed to emerge as a major player in financial services. Same with AT&T and AOL. But at the time the threats felt real, and they spurred us to act. I felt our best hope lay in moving fast, in coming up with a serviceable online product that we could offer our clients at a price that was low enough to generate excitement and dissuade others from entering the market.</li><li>Pricing was a huge challenge. A sudden, rapidly escalating price war had broken out, spurred by newcomers like E*Trade. We found ourselves occupying a price point well above our least expensive competitors. That had to change. We knew that ultimately our costs would come way down, and when they did, we could make money charging less than $70 for internet trades. (A lot less, as it turned out. The advent of internet trading accelerated a 30-year trend during which trades, once fixed and expensive, have essentially become commodities. In many cases today, trades are “free.”)</li><li>“Don’t be afraid to sacrifice revenues if that’s the price you have to pay for market share.”</li><li>As much as I’ve always believed in bringing the power of investing to the masses, Schwab began as a brokerage for individual investors who by definition were sophisticated investors: people who were not scared of the stock market, who preferred to go it alone because they believed they knew better than any broker what was best for them. The little guys came to us in large numbers much later, with the advent of online trading. Those investors were attracted to a new kind of service—delivered privately and efficiently online, and with easy access to research—that coincidentally arrived in the midst of a historic stock market boom.</li><li>Investing well is hard work. Not everybody has the time or inclination to go it alone.</li><li>We were all a little guilty of assuming that since things were going so well, we must be geniuses.</li><li>I told the attendees the story of my first experience with a bubble in the early ’60s when bowling products were all the rage, and how the current situation had a similar feeling of frenzy to it. Weeks later a bowling ball arrived at my office from Stanford, engraved with something I had said to the group, “Can the magic last?” The ball sits in my office today as a good reminder about market euphoria.</li><li>Schwab’s relationship to the market then was like a sailboat’s to the wind. When the wind blew hard, we went fast. During the late 1990s, the wind was blowing 100 miles an hour. Even when average trading volume reached an unprecedented 350,000 trades a day, we didn’t stop to celebrate. Instead, David and his planning group were talking about doubling payroll to 50,000 employees so that we could execute a million trades every day. It was a colossal undertaking. Already they were hard at work building an infrastructure to accommodate all those extra bodies—renting office space, buying chairs and desks and computers, ramping up capacity in every conceivable way.</li><li>THEN IN LATE SPRING 2000 it happened. The wind died and our sails sputtered. Almost overnight, everything was quiet. Suddenly we found ourselves handling a mere 200,000 trades a day, which shocked us until it dipped below 150,000, then 100,000. As quickly and inexplicably as the incredible bull market of the 1990s had begun, it was ending. Like any market top, the precise timing of the bursting of the tech bubble is identifiable only in retrospect.</li><li>We know now that the NASDAQ peaked at 5,048 on March 10, 2000. But who knew it at the time? All we knew then was that valuations were seriously out of whack. A return to some kind of normalcy was inevitable. But just as it had taken us a while to recognize the liftoff for what it was, we did not mark the finality of the crash until much later, when it was fully upon us.</li><li>YOU CAN’T CUT A company to greatness. We had taken lots of expenses out by now, painful as it was, and I knew we had to think forward and find new ways to grow and be more important in our clients’ lives.</li><li>Sometimes you have to push hard when you have a strong instinct and just ignore the naysayers.</li><li>After the dot-com crash in 2000–2003, it became obvious to everyone that Wall Street had terrible incentives for pushing the public into riskier stocks. Stock recommendations by the most reputable firms in the world were shown to be more about smoothing the relationship between investment bankers and CEOs than about providing sound information to ordinary investors.</li><li>But I’ve learned over the years that someone who is the best leader at one point in a company’s evolution may not be the best at another time.</li><li>Again, we have never been the cheapest discount broker, but we have always tried to offer our customers the most value. When investors didn’t think of us anymore as a great value, I felt we lost our identity. (We spent the second half of 2004 and on into 2005 aggressively rebuilding that identity. All told, we would cut prices eight times.)</li><li>I’m all for growth, as I’ve said repeatedly. But I also have an entrepreneur’s natural reluctance to spend, a wariness of overcommitting to fixed costs.</li><li>The life of a business goes through cycles. An idea is new and the company grows and that growth begins to decline as the business matures and new competitors enter the fray. You fight the decline with new ideas and the cycle begins again.</li><li>At times, you just have to shrink the organization so that you can grow again in a new way. When you do so, it’s absolutely essential that you reduce your costs. Get the cost of doing business down to a level that is sustainable, especially if you need to reduce prices to maintain your competitiveness.</li><li>So many people you see in business throw up their hands and can’t do it, or don’t want to do it. It’s too painful, too unpopular. They don’t have the vision and determination to do what’s needed. They end up selling the company voluntarily, or someone comes along and takes it away.</li><li>In my view, when you’re in that kind of situation, you can’t act fast enough or aggressively enough to get back on track. I expect that’s where a lot of management teams go wrong when faced with a big change in their environment. They don’t recognize the need for change and don’t address it quickly. They’re too attached to the things they built, the strategies they concocted, too worried about the consequences of change.</li><li>A turnaround requires a very critical eye, and it needs to be done when you still have the wherewithal to get it done. Wait too long and it gets that much harder, you don’t have any cushion left. You flounder, or worse yet, you find yourself suddenly out the door, with a new owner taking over who is more than willing to act boldly.</li><li>In fact, I believe there are cycles to so much in our lives. From our careers to our relationships, sticking your head in the sand in the face of a challenge or setback just isn’t an option. You need to address the challenge and move forward.</li><li>David acknowledged later in interviews that he felt he had come at the monumental task of reducing costs and unwinding things with some reluctance, when he needed to be tougher. “If I had it to do over again,” he said, “I’d be so much tougher.” There’s no question it’s hard to switch gears from builder to dismantler…but sometimes it’s the only path forward.</li><li>It was a stark road map for sure. But clear. We knew that we had a lot of work to do in two critical areas. One, complete the top-to-bottom streamlining and restructuring begun under David that Chris outlined in the board presentation; and two, something I felt was even more important: restore our spirit, that powerful sense of mission that informed the founding and subsequent growth of Schwab. And that meant we had to reconnect with our clients: cut our prices, cut our source of revenue in the short term, to grow. That is an incredibly hard decision for any business to make. It represents an enormous leap of faith…or true confidence. Better if it’s the latter. We knew that trading was becoming a commodity and would be priced that way. The internet had changed everything. At the peak of the internet bubble, trading revenue was over 40% of our total revenue. Those days were rapidly coming to an end, and that was fine with me. The value in our relationship with clients, and hence our revenue, would come through other products and services such as advice, mutual funds, income solutions, and banking. We had to evolve to thrive.</li><li>I’M CONVINCED THERE ARE times when a founder is the only one who can force the big, often painful steps that need to take place in a turnaround. At least if you want to do it in a way that maintains your culture and sense of purpose. People trust you in a way they can’t with others. They know you’re acting with the company’s founding values front and center, and they are able to line up behind the tough decisions, and even suffer themselves, when it’s in pursuit of a shared vision. And there’s the confidence factor—a faith that you know a way out of this predicament. We’ve seen that happen at Apple, at Nike, at Dell, at Starbucks. Each benefited at crucial moments from a founder stepping back in to push for hard changes. This was one of those times: people needed to understand that our founding principle—total empathy for our clients—was still the driving force behind the company and would lead us forward. People could line up behind that, I knew it.</li><li>We had too many executives at the top and a host of complicated titles. I let a number of executive vice presidents go, each of whom was responsible for at least 500 or more people through their chain of command. It was part of the whole consolidation. All were members of the executive leadership team and were significant contributors. But I knew I had to start at the top. You couldn’t make any moves if you started below. Start at the top—that’s where you change things.</li><li>OF MAJOR CONCERN IN any major transition is reassuring everyone that you have the process well in hand: employees, clients, shareholders, everyone. You have to be calm and in control and crystal clear on your intentions. Just as communication had played a central role when launching Schwab, I knew it had to play a central role when fixing Schwab now.</li><li>In an email to all employees I laid out our vision: Our task is to return to growth and reaffirm the principles on which this firm was founded—to serve serious investors and continue to drive innovation in the financial services industry….We must also follow through on our commitment to lowering costs. Every one of us is responsible for doing everything we can to drive efficiency and reduce costs. I know it’s not easy, but the benefits to the firm—and to shareholders, clients, and ultimately all of us—will be huge. I founded this firm to offer a different—and better—value proposition to our clients and to the marketplace.</li><li>During times of doubt, you need to be very clear, unequivocal.</li><li>Every business faces a challenge like this at some point: you’ve made a strategic mistake, or the environment has thrown you a curveball such as a recession, or a new technology comes along that disrupts your old way of doing business. It is easy to let circumstances take you down if you don’t act decisively.</li><li>There can be lots of reasons you need to act boldly and quickly. I think this is exactly where many great companies stumble. They get stuck in a rut and fade away, or they try to transform and fail.</li><li>Investing is complicated, and financial education is woefully inadequate. As for Schwab, there was a time when I could build a nice tidy business providing savvy investors with the tools they needed to make their own decisions, and then get out of their way. But assuming I wanted this company to keep growing, that was no longer enough. I felt there were too many people still being sold the wrong products and paying too much for them. They didn’t have adequate diversification across asset classes such as stocks and bonds and foreign investments. They may not have understood what asset diversification was. They didn’t have easy means to know how much they were paying for the services they got.</li><li>Successful investing is not easy, that’s the bottom line. It involves so much of your emotions, your sense of self-worth, your ego.</li><li>Investing isn’t easy. Success often requires getting help. I wanted us now to be the ones providing that help.</li><li>The evidence Walt presented made it clear that despite the trends in our industry toward automation and self-service on the internet, relationships were the strongest predictor of client satisfaction, and we needed to advance our abilities in that area. We’ve always used marketing to drive growth, but we needed to strengthen the personal relationships clients had with us to augment good marketing, he said.</li><li>There are great executives with all sorts of backgrounds. But I think the experience of building a company from the ground up gives urgency and a sense of ownership that are often hard to find in people who have never had to play all the roles an owner does, from chief salesperson to check writer and envelope stuffer.</li><li>when it comes to your money, don’t take the status quo for granted.</li><li>It was a risk. But I could see how this could work. No one could say these ads wouldn’t capture the viewer’s attention and make them think. We needed to take some risk. We needed to move forward. And I didn’t want to wait. “This is brilliant,” I said. “Go for it.”</li><li>But there is a lesson in it about acquisitions: understand the culture you’re buying, really figure that one out. Is it compatible with yours? Or do you have an opportunity to transform their culture so it aligns with yours?</li><li>Acquisitions aren’t easy. Many fail, or at least fail to meet their original promise. We’ve made a few over the years that have turned out well—Mayer & Schweitzer, The Hampton Company, Windhaven Investments, Thomas Partners Investments, Compliance Solutions, and optionsXpress—but we avoided big mistakes by passing on hundreds of others. It’s certainly an important part of running a company, watching for those big potholes. You get so confident about things, willing to do anything to acquire companies, but you still have to do your analysis to see, “Does it really fit?” In my experience, the biggest potential problem is always culture.</li><li>I learned early on that if I was going to succeed, I needed to find people whose strengths and capabilities complemented mine. Where I was conceptual and enjoyed developing new products and marketing ideas, I relied on others who had strengths in managing people and implementing complex initiatives. The sooner you recognize your strengths and weaknesses, the faster you can create a team that accounts for those.</li><li>All good leaders have to be humble about their own potential and their skill level and really honor the skills and capabilities and intelligence of the people around them. Delegate. Give good direction without overdefining it. That gives you leverage to do so much more than you could on your own. It also lets people know they are crucial parts of the team.</li><li>There’s no one perfect leader. You can be an extrovert, an introvert, a bit of both: it doesn’t matter. But you have to have real substance, content knowledge that you’ve mastered. You just can’t fake it. And that takes hands-on experience. And then being able to teach other people about it, and why it’s important and how to execute on it. At the same time, you have to have a degree of openness, letting people know that these things are important but that there is flexibility.</li><li>It’s amazing to me the creativity that comes back to you when you find people with passion and you give them lots of responsibility. It underscores my confidence in human energy, creativity, and spirit. When people are focused and committed, with the right sponsorship, they flourish.</li><li>If you’ve made a decision to sell something, my advice is to move fast; there is nothing but risk in waiting.</li><li>To be a successful investor, you’ve got to be an optimist. You have to believe in the innovations that come from the human mind and the human spirit.</li><li>You don’t manage a company according to its stock price, but you don’t ignore it either.</li><li>We must not panic and overreact to the current economic environment and decline in our stock price. “Looking forward and seeing nothing but ultralow interest rates ahead, it would be easy to panic and begin changing almost every part of our business,” he said as we talked it through. “But we don’t want to take the risk of trying to pull a rabbit out of a hat. We should stay the course.”</li><li>We didn’t need to make big changes; we needed to have the resolve to stay the course, keep our expenses in check, invest when we could in improvements to the client experience, and not allow ourselves to get distracted. In many ways, these are often the harder choices to make. It takes great patience and confidence. There is always the enterprising reporter, assertive Wall Street analyst, or short-term-oriented activist stockholder willing to make the case that you’re not doing enough.</li><li>Walt and his team also faced the task of keeping employees focused. It was probably the biggest issue. Some—especially those who hadn’t been around when the internet bubble burst and seen what it had looked like then as we got off our strategy—were voicing concerns about the strategy. “Isn’t it time to do something different?” Walt was hearing. His memo was for them as much as anyone.</li><li>Don’t panic and overreact to the economic environment or the stock price; stay focused on what works.</li><li>in the end, I said, it was really one thing that brought us success: a zealous team of people on a mission that I fondly refer to as “Chuck’s secret sauce,” all of them in lockstep pursuing a simple innovation, total empathy for our clients: make it better, easier, more successful for the investor.</li><li>I called it the mother lode of our innovations, more important than any single technology or new product. It was building a company from a basic belief: view your decisions through your clients’ eyes.</li><li>The secret sauce was building a company from a very simple and basic belief: that you view your decisions through the lens of your clients’ needs and goals. What would they think; what would make their lives better, easier, more productive; what would they believe is the right thing to do? If you do that, then everything else will follow.</li><li>Business is a creative process. You move forward into the unknowable future, try new things, make discoveries along the way, and repeat. It’s all about learning and growth. It is why I love it and the free market of ideas that enables it and makes so many great new things possible. I like to say business is organic, like life itself, ever changing. It is the human spirit of curiosity and creativity brought to life, and why I am ever optimistic about the future.</li>
