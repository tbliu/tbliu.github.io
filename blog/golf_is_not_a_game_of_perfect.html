            <ul>
            <li>Somewhere in the nexus of mind and spirit, which we call free will, [is where] all great champions find the strength to dream their destinies and to honor their commitments to excellence. All great champions are strong on the inside. They all learn that competitive golf either builds character or reveals character. They learn to b e honest about their thoughts. They learn to relish the game's mental and emotional challenges. They learn to appreciate the value of thinking in an athletic manner. Finally they learn that golf is a game, and it has to be played.</li><li>A person with great dreams can achieve great things. A person with small dreams, or a person without the confidence to pursue his or her dreams, has consigned himself or herself to a life of frustration and mediocrity.</li><li>Golfing potential depends primarily oh a player's attitude, on how well he plays with the wedges and the putter, and on how well he thinks.</li><li>Free throws and defense are like the short game in golf. They require not so much talent as determination and commitment. And they are usually what separates teams that win national champtionships from aggregations of slam-dunk artists.</li><li>People by and large become what they think of themselves. It's almost all a person needs to know about how to be happy. [...] Winners and losers are self-determined. But only the winners are willing to admit it.</li><li>A golfer who fears failure--as most amateurs and many professionals do, at least some of the time--tends to think about how he takes the club back, how far he turns, how he cocks his wrists, how he starts the downswing, or other swing mechanics. Inevitably, he will tend to lose whatever grace and rhythm nature has endowed him with, which leads to inconsistent shotmaking with every club, from the driver to the putter. You cannot hit a golf ball consistently well if you think about the mechanics of your swing as you play. [...] I cannot give a scientific reason [why.] I simply know that the human organism performas a task like the golf swing much better if the athlete looks at a target and reacts rather than looks, thinks, and reacts. [...] the only explanation I can come up with for this is that someone created us this way. We are endowed with the most marvelous computer system imaginable, and it is wired to maximize physical performance and grace if a person simply looks at a target and reacts to it.</li><li>The time to worry about swing mechanics must be limited, and the place to worry about them is the practice tee and only the practice tee. [...] A golfer must train his swing and then trust it. When I say this at clinics, someone usually stands up and says that trusting the swing might be all well and good for a Tom Kite or a Nick Price, who has endless hours to practice and who hits the ball almost perfectly almost all of the time. But how can a weekend player who sprays the ball over the course trust his swing? I respond that I have seen lots of high handicappers with lots of kinks in their swings, but I almost never see one who improves his play by doubting himself, dwelling on mechanics or trying to correct a swing flaw in the middle of a round. The fact is, most amateurs don't know exactly what breaks down when they swing badly. If they try to correct their swing, they usually wind up compounding the error. They would be far better off forgetting about their swing mechanics, thinking about appropriate targets and strategy, and making up their mind that they will shoot the best score possible with the swing they brought to the course that day.</li><li>When great atheltes stop trusting, they stop being great. The difference in a player's attitude can be very subtle. A little doubt or a little indecision is sufficient to impair performance.</li><li>Most golfers, even mid to high handicappers, if they play often, have experienced a string of holes where everything fell into place, and for a while at least, they played the golf they always sensed they were capable of [...] Then something happened to break the spell--an errant tee shot, a stubbed chip, a three-putt green.  They went back to makeing bogeys. Perhaps they thought that during the hot streak they played over their head. They did not. The hot streak represents the golfer's true capability.</li><li>Trusting won't, by itself, turn on a hot streak. But it will make a hot streak much more likely. You can't wait until a few putts fall and a couple of birdies go on the scorecard before you start trusting. You have to start replicating the state of mind you have on a hot streak as soon as you step onto the first tee. No matter what happens during your round, you have to strive to maintain that state of mind. You have to stay out of your own way.</li><li>A player has to pass through three stages: unconsciously incompetent, consciously competent, and unconsciously competent.</li><li>If thinking about swing mechanics can spoil a golf swing, what should a golfer think about as he stands over the ball? [...] When Ben Hogan came to the 5th hole, a 476-yeard par five on which the green, because of the slope of the land is not visible from the tee. A cluster of four tall palm tree, planted only a few feet apart, stands imediately behind the green and towers above the horizon. When Hogan arrived at the tee, he asked his caddie for a target. "Aim for the palm trees, Mr. Hoga," the caddie replied. To which Hogan answered, "Which palm tree?" The story is cited sometimes as an example of Hogan's perfectionism. But what it really suggests is Hogan's knowledge of one of the fundamental psychological principles in golf: Before taking any shot, a golfer must pick out the smallest possible target.</li><li>[Usually golfers will say they were] "aiming down the left side." Or "down the middle". Or people might say, "I don't know what I aws aiming at. I just knew I didn't want to miss left." That's not good enough. Aiming down the middle is the equivalent of trying to go to Los Angeles by flying to an airport somewhere in California. The brain and nervous system respond best when they eyes focus on the smallest possible target. [...] A small target has another benefit. A golfer needs to have something on his mind if he does not want thoughts about swing mechanics to intrude on his consciousness just as he is preparing to play his shot. The target helps fill that void. It helps prevent distractions.</li><li>One of the key attributes of the brain and how it affects your golf game [is that] at some level, it cannot seem to understand the word "don't". If your last thought before striking the ball is "don't hit it in the pond," your brain is likely to react by telling your muscles to hit it in the pond.</li><li>The foundation of consistency is a sound preshot routine. You will find a remarkable consistency watching players like Tom Kite. These golfers strive to repeat the same mental and physical steps before every shot, right down to the number of waggles.</li><li>The important thing about club selection is decisiveness. If you step up to the ball still uncertain whether you have the right club, your routine is not soundd. You have to stsart over, rethinking the shot until you are convinced you have the right club for it. [...] The most important thing is that you know the ball is going to the target. If you can't make yourself believe it, pick another club or another target until you can. If you've got a driver in your hands and you can't believe that the ball is going to go where you want it, put it back in the bag and take a 3-wood or an iron. Instilling this unwavering belief in the shot is one of the fundamentals without which your routine loses its purpose. Remember that the point of the routine is not to go through a physical ritual. It is to get your body aligned properly and your mind in an effective state before every shot.</li><li>Look at the target, look at the ball, and swing. Your brain and body work best together when the brain reacts to a target. Once you have copleted your setup and locked onto your target, further delay can only be an opportunity for unwanted thoughts and distractions to disturb your concentration and pollute that pure and unconscious reaction.</li><li>There is a distinction between being indecisive at the beginning of the routine and being distracted close to the end of the routine. A player should never hit a shot if he is distracted and not absolutely ready. If this means backing away from the ball and starting the routine over again, so be it.</li><li>Have no swing thoughts whatsoever from 120 yards and in. THink only of the target. [...] From inside your threshold distance, think about holing the shot. Don't just go for the middle of the green and don't just try to get it close.</li><li>Attitude is what makes a great putter. Putting is largely mental, and you have control over your mind and attitude. To become a good putter, you must make a commitment to good thinking. You have to fill your mind with thoughts that will help you, not excuses for poor putting. You have to decide that, come what may, you love putting and you're glad that every hole gives you a chance to use your putter, because that's where you've got a big advantage over all the players who dread putting.</li><li>People who overread [the green] are, as Billy Casper once said, often really looking for a way to miss rather than a way to make the putt. And they forget the most important principle: It's more important to be decisive about a read than correct. [...] Speed [on the greens] is a critical factor, but I don't advise players to think too much about it. The best putters don't.</li><li>There is a way of thinking that can help you get the speed right. For a downhill putt, tell yourself that you want the ball to barely make it over the front lip of the cup on its last rotation. For an uphill putt, you might think of hitting the ball so it strikes the back of the cup as it does down. [...] If you miss short very often, it may be a sign of tentativeness and indecision. People who leave it short due to fear are afraid of running it too far past the hole and missing the return putt. If that's why someone is leaving putts short, it's a problem to be corrected.</li><li>Golfers [...] in their eagerness to stop leaving their putts short (and being called "Alice") or to stop running them too far past can lose focus of the real goal, which is putting the ball into the cup. The putter who is called Alice on the first green runs putts five or ten feet past on the next seventeen holes. Or the putter who runs one way past on the first green becomes tentative. What they don't do is knock anything difficult into the hole.</li><li>So you've read the green decisively and picked out a line or a target. You may at this point in your routine want to take a couple of practice strokes. Take them with your eyes on the target, not the ball, and certainly not the putter blade. Use them to make sure you feel the right stroke for the distance the ball has to travel. If you look at the ball or the blade, it will only introduce questions into your mind about the path the blade is taking, mechanical questions that divert you from your focus on the target. [...] Look at the target. Look at the ball. Let the putt go.<br />[Author Note: Use the ball lettering or your own markings to align the ball with the path of your stroke to target.]</li><li>On long putts, the biggest fallacy I see players falling for is the three-foot target. This is an imaginary circle with a radius of three feet and the hole at the center. Some teachers suggest a player facing a long putt should try only to get the ball inside this circle. This makes no sense. Think about an archer or a pistol shooter. They shoot at an artificial target with a bull's-eye and concentric outer circles. But no matter what the distance, they always aim for the bull's-eye. It gives them the biggest margin of error. Even if they miss it, they're likely to hit something on the target. The same principle applies to putting. Always aim to make it.</li><li>Golf is not a game of perfect. This does not mean that a pro doesn't strive to eliminate mistakes from his game. But he understands that while striving for perfection is essential, demanding perfection of himself on the golf course is deadly. [...] No matter what happens with any shot you hit, accept it. Acceptance is the last step in a sound routine. [...] Good golfers have to get over the notion that they only want to win by hitting perfect shots. They have to learn to enjoy winning ugly. And that entails acceptance of all the shots they hit, not just the good ones.</li><li>Golf is a game played by human beings. Therefore, golf is a game of mistakes. The best golfers strive to minimize mistakes, but they don't expect to eliminate them. ANd they understand that it's important to respond well to the mistakes they inevitably make.</li><li>Anyone can develop confidence if he or she goes about it properly. Confidence isn't something you're born with or something you're given. You control it. Confidence is what you think about yourself and your golf game. [...] Being confident doesn't mean that I don't know that 2 percent is a good average on 40-foot putts. It means that when I'm standing over a 40-foot putt, no one is asking me to bet my house, and I'm not thinking about averages. I'm thinking about putting the ball in the hole. And that's all I'm thinking about. Great athletes think this way. It would never occur to one of them to ask me whether I would bet my hosue on a 40-foot putt. People would understand this better, I think, if confidence guaranteed success. It doesn't. Standing on the tee and thinking about your drive going to the target doesn't guarantee that it will go there. It only enhances the chances. If it guaranteed success, people would more readily get the idea. But they try thinking confidently, and as soon as a shot doesn't succeed they think, "Well, that doesn't work." But look at it another way. If you're not thinking about your drive going to the target, what are you thinking about? Obviously, you're thinking about it going somewhere--into a lake maybe. And that kind of thinking definitely works, assuming you want to hit the ball in the lake. Negative thinking is almost 100 percent effective.</li><li>Your confidence is the sum of all the thoughts you have about yourself as a golfer. You've got to think about what you want your golf game to be. You've got to think about driving it well, wedging it well, being a great bunker player, being a superb putter. [...] By its nature, golf will try to sap your confidence. Over the course of a year, even the best golfer will lose more tournaments than he wins. So maintaining confidence in golf is like swimming against a current. You have to work hard to stay where you are. I tell players to try to feel that their confidence is increasing over the course of every round, every tournament and every season [...] THey can do this if they learn to be selective about their thoughts and their memories. They have to learn to monitor their thinking and ask themselves whether an idea that springs to mind is likely to help them or hurt them in the efforts to grow more confident. If it won't help them, they have to make a conscious coice to put that thought out of their mind and turn to one that will enhance their confidence. THey have to focus on what they want to happen, be it a particular shot or an entire career. Everyone thinks this way some of the time. Doing it consistently is a habit that requires disciplined effort.</li><li>The inability to forget is infinitely more devastating than the inability to remember. [...] The question is, as you stand over a ball and prepare to hit it, which shots do you choose to remember.</li><li>Courage is fear turned inside out. It is impossible to be courageous if at first you weren't afraid.</li><li>My conversations with Seve reminded me of how a player can get lost trying to improve. It's not enough to decide to get better and to be willing to work hard at it. A player has to judge carefully whether the improvement nostrums he's being offered are right for him.</li><li>The key to successful strategy and a confident swing for golfers at every level is: Hit the shot you know you can hit, not the shot Arnold Palmer would hit, nor even the shot you think you ought to be able to hit. I teach a conservative strategy and a cocky swing. You want to play each hole in such a way that you're confident you can execute each shot you attempt. That gives you a cocky swing, which is another way of saying that you swing aggressively, that you swing with trust. It produces the best results.</li><li>You must play every significant round with a game plan. Amateur golfers, particularly high-handicappers, frequently don't understand this. They play spontaneously, making up strategy on the fly. As a result, they make more bad decisions. A good professional never plays a tournament round without first examining the course and preparing a plan to play it. The plan encompasses target and club selection for each tee shot, the preferred landing area on every green, and hazards to be avoided, it envisioins responses to rain, wind, and other weather variables.</li><li>Positive thinking does not mean taking a rip at every risky shot the course presents. It is, rather, the development and execution of an intelligent strategy that weighs risks and rewards and gives a player a chance to shoot his best possible score. [...] This is not negative thinking. It's honest thinking.</li><li>Your game plan must always have flexibility. You must think in advance about what you will do if the wind blows strongly [or] if it rainsk, or the course is soggy [...] I recommended altering your game plan only in a conservative direction. I don't hink to see players under pressure make bolder and more aggressive choices than their plan calls for. Too often, the new choice winds up costing them more strokes. Any time you're not sure, make the more conservative choice.</li><li>A golfer chokes when he lets anger, doubt, fear, or some other extraneous factor distract him before a shot. Distracted, the golfer then fails to do one or more of the things he normally does [...] Quite often under pressure, a distracting doubt or fear turns on the conscious mind.</li><li>Being nervous can help performance [...] Being nervous produces adrenaline. Being very nervous can produce a great gush of adrenaline. That can cause the heart to pound. It can cause the hands a shake. In a young golfer, or an older golfer who hasn't learned how to handle it, this gush of adrenaline can be devastating. He feels the trembling hands and the furiously beating heart. He doesn't understand that this is simply a natural reaction to the situtation. It's the way his body is wired. He begins to think, "What the heck is wrong with me?" And that thought introduces doubt and fear, which are the termites that destroy the foundation of the successful stroke.<br />[Author note: Nervousness is a physical condition which can be beneficial. Fear is a mental condition which will always be devastating]</li><li>The successful golfer either has learned, or instinctively understands, that the pounding heart and the trembling hands are nothing to worry about. They are, at worst, another factor to be accounted for, like a following wind. The successful golfers knows taht rather than concern himself with stilling the hands and quieting the heart, he must focus the mind, blocking out distractions and attending to routine and strategy just as meticulously as if this were a practice round. The body can and probably will stay excited. The mind must not.</li><li>Being nervous on the golf course is a little bit like being nervous the first time you make love with someone you really care about. Nearly everyone is nervous in that situation, but nerves are part of what makes the experience so exhilirating. If it didn't make you nervous, it wouldn't be so gratifying. In fact, it might be a little boring. Ask any prostitute.</li><li>If a swing is good enough to repeat itself on the practice tee, it is good enough to repeat itself on the golf course, as long as the golfer's thoughts remain consistent. Swings don't hold up under pressure. People do.</li><li>Choking is not a congenital, incurable disease. It can be overcome if the golfer intelligently analyzes what went wrong in a particular situation and takes steps to correct it.</li><li>First, stay in the present and keep your mind sharply focused on the shot immediately in front of you. Second, avoid mechanical thoughts. Instead strive to become looser, freer, and more confident. Third, stick to your routine and your game plan.</li><li>A golfer should always assume that his opponent will hit the best possible shot. Then, if it happens, he'll be prepared to cope with it.</li><li>I advise players at all levels to cherish their competitors. It's better for their games. It's better for them. Never decide that you can't stand another golfer, because you might find yourself paired with that golfer for the most important round of your life. On the other hand, a golfer can't let admiration for a competitor intimidate him. A golfer has to choose someone to believe in. It had better be himself.</li><li>"You've got to go in there with the attitude that you're better than they are until they prove otherwise, rather than the attitude that they're better than you until you prove otherwise. Put the burden of proof on them."</li><li>In golf, working hard does not guarantee success. It can even make things worse. Doing the wrong things in practice can ruin your golfing mind. To improve, you must practice. But the quality of your practice is more important than the quantity<br />.</li><li>There are two states of mind in practice--the training mentality and the trusting mentality. In the training mentality, the golfer tries to make things happen. In the trusting mentality, the golfer lets things happen. The training mentality is very thoughtful. The trusting mentality feels like reckless abandon. The training mentality is impatient. The trusting mentality is patient. In the training mentality, a player may just rake ball after ball into position, working on something mechanical. In the trusting mentality, he goes through his shotmaking routine with every ball he hits. [...] The dominant habit is the one an athlete practices most. Therefore: You must spend at least 60 percent of your practice time in the trusting mentality.</li><li>Any player, whether touring pro or weekend duffer, should spend the majority of his practice time on the short game, on shots of 120 yards or less.</li><li>If a child dreams about becoming a professional golfer, she will encounter disappointment and failure along the way. But why worry about that? People develop pride and find satisfaction, not from doing things that are easy, but from trying things that are difficult, that most people don't even dare to aspire to. I never tell a youngster or anyone else to put aside a dream. [...] The answer for anyone, of any age, who is propelled by a dream is a balanced commitment. No one should spend all of his time chasing the dream of becoming a great golfer. But during those hours that he sets aside each day to pursue that dream, he ahs to give golf his undivided attention and energy. And he has to put those hours in every day, regardless of heat, humidity, cold, and wind. He has to put them in on the days when he seems stalled on an infinite plateau as well as on days when he feels the gratification of noticeable improvement. And he needs to realize that commitment need not warp his personality and behavior.</li><li>Sometimes, with professionals, I find problems of overcommitment. A player is so intent on performing well that he starts to forget that trying harder is not always trying better. And he starts to forget that the game is supposed to be fun. [...] "None of us are going to get out of here alive. You might as well have some fun while you're here."</li><li>On the other hand, I sometimes run into people who think they can become scratch golfers without making a commitment. They can't. [...] You have to make a long-term improvement plan and a commitment. Your plan should include how many times a week you will practice, what you will work on, and for how long. It should include lots of time for short-game practice. Then you must execute that plan. [Successful golfers] generally do find time to practice [...] They never waste practice time mindlessly hitting balls. They practice with a purpose.</li><li>You have the power to make choices. You have the power to think in ways that will help your game. You have the power to make a commitment and keep it. THe happiest people have a sense of commitment in everything they do, whether it's playing golf, running a restaurant, or selling hardware. They approach their undertakings with passion.</li>
