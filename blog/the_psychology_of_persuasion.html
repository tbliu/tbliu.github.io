            <ul>
            <li>There is something odd about [the way turkey mothers raise their young]. Virtually of their mothering is triggered by one thing: the "cheep-cheep" sound of young turkey chicks [...] If a chick makes the "cheep-cheep" noise, its mother will care for it; if not, the mother will ignore or sometimes kill it.</li><li>Called fixed-action patterns, they [e.g. the mother turkey's response to "cheep-cheep"] can involve intricate sequences of behavior [...] Click and the appropriate tape is activated; whirr and out rolls the standard sequence of behaviors.</li><li>If a man has just spent a lot of money to purchase a suit, he may be reluctant to spend very much more on the purchase of a sweater. But the clothiers know better. They behave in accordance with what the contrast principle would suggest: Sell the suit first, because when it comes time to look at sweaters, their prices will not seem as high in comparison. A man might balk at the idea of spending $95 for a sweater, but if he has just bought a $495 suit, a $95 sweater does not seem excessive.</li><li>Rule 1: The rule of reciprocation</li><li>[The rule of reciprocation] says that we should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us. If a woman does us a favor, we should do her one in return; if a man sends us a birthday present, we should remember his birthday with a gift of our own [...] By virtue of the reciprocity rule, then we are obligated to the future repayment of favors, gifts, invitations, and the like.<br />[Self note: Even kids seem to intuitively understand this rule. For example, a kid running for class president giving their classmates cupcakes before the election]</li><li>People we might ordinarily dislike--unsavory or unwelcome sales operators, dsiagreeable acquaintances, representatives of strange or unpopular organizations--can greatly increase the chance that we will do what they wish merely by providing us with a small favor prior to their requests.<br />[Self note: Perhaps this is why certain companies like Facebook lobby both Republicans and Democrats despite both parties not liking it]<br />[Author note: The rule is overpowering]</li><li>Another person can trigger a feeling of indebtedness by doing us an uninvited favor. The rule only states that we should provide to others the kind of actions they have provided us; it does not require us to have asked for what we have received in order to feel obligated to repay. [...] The rule was established to promote the development of reciprocal relationships between individuals so that one person could initiate [a social] relationship without the fear of loss.<br />[Self note: Can use this rule to expand your social relationships (good) or to take advantage of others (bad)]<br />[Author note: The obligation to repay exists, as well as the obligation to receive a gift and not turn it down]</li><li>The rule developed to promote equal exchanges between partners, yet it can be used to bring about decidedly unequal results. [...] The rule allows one person to choose the nature of the indebting first favor [e.g. buying a coke for someone] and the nature of the debt-cancelling return favor [e.g. buying that person's raffle tickets], we could easily be manipulated into an unfair exchange by those who might wish to exploit the rule.<br />[Self note: Maybe the (sub-)conscious reason why a man will buy a woman a drink at the bar? So she feels obligated to sleep with him?]</li><li>Another consequence of the [reciprocity rule], however, is an obligation to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us. [...] I changed from noncompliant to compliant when [the salesman] changed from a larger to a smaller request, even though I was not really interested in either of the things he offered.</li><li>[The rejection-then-retreat technique:] Suppose you want me to agree to a certain request. One way to increase your chances would be first to make a larger request of me, one that I will most likely turn down. Then, after I have refused, you would make the smaller request that you were really interested in all along. Provided that you have structured your requests skillfully, I should view your second request as a concession to me and should feel inclined to respond with a concession of omy own, the only one I would have immediately open to me--compliance with your second request.</li><li>It would appear, then, that the larger the initial request, the more effective the procedure, since there would be more room available for illusory concessions. This is true only up to a point, however. [...] The rejection-then-retreat technique shows that if the first set of demands is so extremem as to be seen as unreasonable, the tactic fires.<br />[Self note: "Pigs get fed; hogs get slaughtered]</li><li>Given the remarkable effectiveness of the rejection-then-retreat technique, one might think [...] the victims of the strategy might resent having been cornered into compliance [and] might decided not to live up to the verbal agreement made with the requestor [or] might come to distrust the manipulative requester, deciding never to deal with him again. [...] Research indicates, however, that these victim reactions do not occur with increased frequency [...] Somewhat astonishingly, it appears that they actually occur less frequently!</li><li>[With regards to saying no:] A policy of blanket rejection seems ill advised [because there are people acting authentically. Instead] if a person offers us a nice favor, let's say, we might well accept, recognizing that we hav obligated ourselves to a return favor sometime in the future. To engage in this sort of arrangement with another is not to be exploited by that person through the rule for reciprocation. It is to participate fairly in the "honored network of obligation" [...] However, if the initial favor turns out to be a device, a trick, designed specifically to stimulate our compliance with a larger return favor [...] our partner no longer has the reciprocation rule as an ally: The rule says that favors are to be met with favors; it does not require that tricks be met with favors.</li><li>The reciprocity rule asserts that if justice is to be done, exploitation attempts should be exploited.</li><li>Rule 2: Commitment and consistency</li><li>[A common weapon of social influence is] our nearly obsessive desire to be (and to appear) consistent with what we have already done. Once we have made a choice or taken a stand, we will encounter personal and interpresonal pressures to behave consistetly with that commitment. Those pressures will cause us to respond in ways that justify our earlier decision.</li><li>It appears automatic consistency functions as a shield against thought, it should not be surprising that such consistency can also be exploited by those who would prefer that we not think too much in response to their requests for compliance.<br />[Author story: https://www.martialdevelopment.com/comforts-of-mindless-consistency/]</li><li>[Commitment is key:] If I can get you to make a commitment (that is, to take a stand, to go on record), I will have set the stage for your automatic and ill-considered consistency with that earlier commitment. Once a stand is taken, there is a natural tendency to behave in ways that are stubbornly consistent with the stand.</li><li>During the Korean War, many captured American soldiers found themselves in prisoner-of-war camps run by the Chinese Communists. It became quite clear early in the conflict that the Chinese treated captives quite differently than their allies, the North Koreans, who favored savagery and harsh punishment to gain compliance. Specifically avoiding the appearance of brutality, the Red Chinese engaged in what they termed their "lenient policy," which was in reality a concerted an sophisticated psychological assault on their captives. [...] For example, the Chinese were very effective in getting Americans to inform on one another, in striking contrast to the behavior of American POWs in WW2. For the reason, among others, escape plans were quickly uncovered and the escape attempts themselves almost always unsuccessful. [...] In fact, nearly all American prisoners in the Chinese camps are said to have collaborated with the enemy in one form or another.</li><li>The Chinese [got Americans to comply using commitment and consistency pressures by starting] small and building. For instance, prisoners were frequently asked to make statements so mildly anti-American or pro-Communist as to seem inconsequential ("The United States is not perfect". "In a Communist country, unemployment is not a problem".) But once these minor requests were complied with, the men found themselves pushed to submit to related yet more substantive requests. A man who had just agreed with his Chinese interrogator that the U.S. is not perfect might then be asked to indicate some of the ways in which he thought this was the case. Once he had so explained himself, he might be asked to make a list of these "problems with America" and to sign his name to it. Later he might be asked to read his list in a discussion group with other prisoners. [...] Suddenly he would find himself a "collaborator", having given aid to the enemy. Aware he had written the essay without any strong threats or coercion, many times a man would change his image of himself to be consistent with the deed and with the new "collaborator" label, often resulting in even more extensive acts of collaboration.<br />[Self note: "Give an inch, and they'll take a mile". Never compromise with those who act in bad faith.]<br />[Author note: The tactic of starting with a little request in order to gain eventual compliance with related larger requests has a name: the foot-in-the-door technique.]<br />[Author note: After complying with a small request, a person's attitude may change. He may become, in his own eyes, the kind of person who does this sort of thing, who agrees to requests made by strangers, who takes action on things he believes in, who cooperates with good causes.]</li><li>[Any small] action has the potential to influence not only your future behavior but also your self-image in ways you may not want. And once a person's self-image is altered, all sorts of subtle advantages become available to someone who wants to exploit that new image.</li><li>It is important to understand that the major intent of the Chinese was not simply to extract information from their prisoners. It was to indoctrinate them, to change their perceptions of themselves, of their political system, of their country's role in the war, and of communism. And there is evidence that the program often worked alarmingly well. Returning POWs at the war's end, reported that the war-related beliefs had been substantially shifted. The majority of the men believed the Chinese story that the U.S. had used germ warfare, and many felt that their own forces had been the initial aggressors in starting the war.</li><li>It was never enough for the prisoners to listen quietly or even to agree verbally with the Chinese line; they were always pushed to write it down as well. So intent were the Chinese on securing a written statement that if a prisoner was not willing to write a desired response freely, he was prevailed upon to copy it [...] the Chinese knew that, as a commitment device, a written declaration has some great advantages. First, it provides physical evidence that the act occurred [...] A second advantage of a written testament is that it can be shown to other people. Of course, that means it can be used to persuade those people, [and can] persuade them that the author genuinely believes what was written. People have a natural tendency to think that a statement reflects the true attitude of the person who made it. What is surprising is that they continue to think so even when they know that the person did not freely choose to make the statement.</li><li>[From a memo to sales personnel at Amway:] One final tip before you get started: Set a goal and write it down. Whatever the goal, the important thing is that you set it, so you've got something for which to aim--and that you write it down. There is something magical about writing things down. So set a goal and write it down. When you reach that goal, set another and write that down. You'll be off and running.</li><li>One reason that written testaments are effective in bringing about genuine personal change is that they can be so easily made public. Public commitments tend to be lasting commitments. [...] Whenever one takes a stand that is visible to others, there arises a drive to maintain that stand in order to look like a consistent person. The more public a stand, the more reluctant we will be to change it.</li><li>Someone without consistency is judged as fickle, uncertain, pliant, scatterbrained, or unstable; someone with it is viewed as rational, assured, trustworthy, and sound.<br />[Self note: Is this why we accuse politicians of being flip-floppers if they change their stance on an issue? Even when it might be the right thing to do with more information?]<br />[Self note: "Don't open your mouth until you know what the shot is".]</li><li>Evidence is clear that the more effort that goes into a commitment, the greater is its ability to influence the attitudes of the person who made it. [Book example: Tribal rites of passages, fraternity hell weeks].</li><li>[There are six major trials that are common during different initations:] Beatings, exposure to cold, thirst, eating unsavory foods, punishment, and threats of death</li><li>Persons who go through a great deal of trouble or pain to attain something tend to value it more highly than persons who attain the same thing with a minimum of effort. [...] Now the harassments, the exertions, even the beatings of initation rituals begin to make sense. The Thonga tribesman watching, with tears in his eyes, his ten-year-old son tremble through a night on the cold ground of the "yard of mysteries", the college sophomore punctuating his Hell Night paddling of his fraternity "little brother" with bursts of nervous laughter--these are not acts of sadism. They are acts of group survival. They function, oddly enough, to spur future society members to find the group more attractive and worthwhile. As long as it is the case that people like and believe in what they have struggled to get, these groups will continue to arrange effortful and troublesome initiation rights. The loyalty and dedication of those who emerge will increase to a great degree the chances of group cohesiveness and survival.</li><li>The surveyed fraternities refused to allow civic activities [community service] into their initiation ceremonies for the same reason the Chinese withheld large prizes in favor of less powerful inducements: They wanted the men to own what they had done. No excuses, no ways out were allowed. A man who suffered through an arduous hazing could not be given the chance to believe he did so for charitable purposes. A prisoner who salted his political essay with a few anti-American comments could not be permitted to shrug if off as motivated by a big reward. [...] It was not enough to wring commitments out of their men; those men had to be made to take inner responsibility for their actions.</li><li>All this has important implications for rearing children. It suggests that we should never heavily bribe or threaten our children to do the things we want them truly to believe in. Such pressures will probably produce temporary compliance with our wishes. However, if wew want more than just that, if we want the children to believe in the correctness of what they have done, if we want the to continue to perform the desired behavior when we are not present to apply those outside pressures, then we must somehow arrange for them to take inner responsibility for the actions we want them to take.</li><li>The first signal [to recognize when to say no to your mechanical consistency] is easy to recognize. It occurs right in the pit of our stomachs when we realize we are trapped into complying with a request we know we don't want to perform.<br />[Author note: Listen to your gut! If anyone tries to push you by using the consistency principle, just explain to them what they're doing--and that you're onto them.]<br />[Author note: Another question you can ask yourself to fight against foolish consistency is: "Knowing what I know now about _______, if I could go back in time, would I make the same choice again?"]</li><li>Rule 3: Social Proof ("Where all think alike, no one thinks very much." -- Walter Lippmann)</li><li>The principle of social proof states that one means we use to determine what is correct is to find out what other people think is correct. The principle applies especially to the way we decide what constitutes correct behavior.<br />[Author examples: how fast to drive on the highway, laugh tracks in a TV show, how to eat a certain food at a dinner party]<br />[Self note: Similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments ?]<br />[Self note: Similar to http://www.paulgraham.com/cornpone.html ?]</li><li>As a rule, we will make fewer mistakes by acting in accord with social evidence than contrary to it. Usually, when a lot of people are doing something, it is the right thing to do.</li><li>In general, when we are unsure of ourselves, when the situation is unclear or ambiguous, when uncertainty reigns, we are most likely to look to and accept the actions of others as correct. In the process of examining the reactions of other people to resolve our uncertainty, however, we are likely to overlook a subtle but important fact. Those people are probably examining the social evidence, too. Especially in an ambiguous situation, the dendency for everyone to be looking to see what everyone else is doing can lead to a phenomenon called "pluralistic ignorance".</li><li>One example of pluralistic ignorance is the failure of entire groups of bystanders to aid victims in agonizing need of help.<br />[Author note: See Catherine Genovese]</li><li>Psychologists speculated that, for at least two reasons, a bystander to an emergency would be unlikely to help when there were a number of bystanders present. The first is that the personal responsibility is reduced: "Perhaps someone else will give or call for aid, perhaps someone else already has." So with everyone thinking that someone else will help or has helped, no one does. The second is founded on the principle of social proof and the pluralistic ignorance effect. Very often an emergency is not obviously an emergency. Is a man lying in the alley having a heart-attack or a drunk sleeping it off? In times of uncertainty, the natural tendency is to look around at the actions of others for clues, but we forget that everybody else is looking for social evidence too. Because we prefer to appear poised and unflustered among others, we are likely to search for that evidence placidly. As a result, the event will be roundly interpreted as a nonemergency.</li><li>In order to devictimize yourself, you should be call out clearly your need for assistance. You must not allow bystanders to define your situation as a nonemergency. [...] You must also remove bystanders' uncertainties about how that assistance should be provided and who should provide it.<br />[Author example: Clearly call out someone and request specific aid, e.g.: "You in the blue jacket, I need help. Call 911"]</li><li>No leader can hope to persuade, regularly and single-handedly, all the members of the group. A forceful leader can reasonably expect to persuade some sizable proportion of group members. Then the raw information that a substantial number of group members has been convinced can convince the rest. Thus, the most influential leaders are those who know how to arrange group conditions to allow the principle of social proof to work maximally in their favor.</li><li>How to say no: There are two situations where the principle of social proof give us poor counsel. The first occurs when social evidence has been purposely falsified (e.g. laugh tracks on TV). Because little to no attempts are made to hide using social proof as a weapon, we can make any necessary corrections once we recognize the situation before turning back our "autopilot".</li><li>In addition to the times when social evidence is deliberately faked, there is another time when the principle of social proof will regularly steer us wrong. [...] Quite frequently, the crowd is mistaken because they are not acting on the basis of any superior information but are reacting to the principle of social proof. [...] An automatic-pilot device like social proof, should never be trusted fully; even when no saboteur has fed bad information into the mechanism, it can sometimes go haywire by itself. [...] Fortunately, this precaution requires neither much effor nor time. A quick glance around is all that is needed.<br />[Self note: Ask "why?" instead of blindly doing]<br />[Self note: If stocks go down, and everyone's selling, do you sell? Don't panic sell or FOMO buy!]</li><li>Rule 5: Liking</li><li>As a rule, we most prefer to say yes to the requests of someone we know and like.</li><li>Because we like attractive people and because we tend to comply with those we like, it makes sense that sales training programs include grooming hints, that fashionable clothiers select their floor staffs from among the good-looking candidates, and that con men are handsome and con women pretty.</li><li>Similarity: We like people who are similar to us, whether the similarity is in the area of opinions, personality traits, background, or life-style.</li><li>Similarity: Even small similarities can be effective in producing a positive response to another and because a veneer of similarity can be so easily manufactured, take special caution in the presence of requesters who claim to be "just like you". Indeed it would be wise these days to be careful around salespeople who just seem to be just like you. Many sales training programs now urge trainees to "mirror and match" the customer's body posture, mood, and verbal style, as similarities along each of these dimensions have been shown to lead to positive results.</li><li>Compliments: The information that someone fancies us can be a bewitchingly effective device for producing return liking and willing compliance.</li><li>Compliments: Although there are limits to our gullibility--especially when we can be sure that the flatterer is trying to manipulate us--we tend, as a rule, to believe praise and to like those who provide it, oftentimes when it is clearly false.</li><li>Contact and Cooperation (C&C): We like things that are familiar to us. Often we don't realize that our attitude toward something has been influenced by the number of times we have been exposed to it in the past.</li><li>C&C: Research shows that becoming familiar with something through repeated contact doesn't necessarily cause greater liking. In fact, continued exposure to a person or object under unpleasant conditions such as frustration, conflict, or competition leads to less liking.<br />[Self note: Author uses the example of school desegregation here. When integrating public schools, blacks' and whites' perceptions of each other decreasing, rather than increased, despite increased contact and familiarity]</li><li>C&C: The recipe for disharmony is quick and easy: Just separate the participants into gruops and let sit for a while in their own juices. Then mix together over the flame of continued competition. And there you have it: Cross-group hatred at a rolling boil. [Researchers tried resolving this by] bringing the bands together more often. But even when the joint activities were pleasant ones, the resultswere disastrous. [The solution, they found, was to construct] a series of situations in which competition between the groups would have harmed everyone's interests, in which cooperation was necessary for omutual benefit.</li><li>Conditioning and Association (C&A): The nature of bad news infects the teller. There is a natural human tendency to dislike a person who brings us unpleasant information, even when that person did not cause the bad news.</li><li>C&A: People assume that we have the same personality traits as our friends. [Guilt by association]</li><li>C&A: The "Luncheon technique": Subjects become fonder of the people and things they experienced while they were eating. [...] And these changes in liking seem to have occurred unconsciously, since the subjects could not remember which of the statements they had seen during the food service.<br />[Author's note: See Pavlov's dog]</li><li>C&A: As Isaac Asimov put it in describing our reactions to the contests we view, "All things being equal, you root for your own sex, your own culture, your own locality...and what you want to prove is that you are better than the other person. Whomever you root for represents you; and when he wins, you win"<br />[Author's note: See sports fans and their enthusiasm for their team]</li><li>C&A: We purposefully manipulate the visibility of our connections with winners and losers in order to make ourselves look good to anyone who could view these connections. By showcasing the positive associations and burying the negative ones, we are trying to get observers to think more highly of us and to like us more. One of the simplest examples is in the pronouns we use. Have you noticed how often after a home-team victory fans shout "We're number one! We're number one!" Note that the call is not "They're number one" or even "Our team is number one." The pronoun is "we", designed to imply the closest possible identity with the team. Nothing similar occurs in the case of failure. No one will ever hear the chant, "We're in last place! We're in last place!"<br />[Self note: Reminds me of how whenever I do something bad, my mom will say "your son" to my dad, but "our son" whenever I do something good]</li><li>C&A: We will be most likely to use this approach when we feel that we don't look so good. [People who do this perpetually have] a poor self-concept. Deep inside is a sense of low personal worth that directs them to seek prestige not from the generation of promotion of their own attainments, but from the generation or promotion of their association with others of attainment. For example, someone who trades sexual favors for the right to tell girlfriends that she was "with" a famous musician for a time. No matter which form it takes, the behavior of such individuals shares a similar theme--the rather tragic view of accomplishment as deriving from outside the self.</li><li>How to Say No: Rather than trying to recognize and prevent the action of liking factors before they have a chance to work on us, we might be well advised to let them work. Our vigilence should be directed not toward the things that may produce undue liking for a compliance practictioner [e.g. physical attractiveness, familiarity, association], but toward the fact that undue liking has been produced. The time to react protectively is when we feel ourselves liking the practitioner more than we should under the circumstances.</li><li>Rule 6: Authority ("Follow an expert" -- Virgil)</li><li>When it is their job, how much suffering will ordinary people be willing to inflict on an entirely innocent other person?<br />[Author example: Milgram experiment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment]<br />[Author note: Under the Milgram experiment, people in the "Teacher" role continued to deliver increasingly large shocks because of a deep-seated sense of duty to authority within us all. Subjects didn't want to defy the wishes of the boss of the study--the lab-coated researcher, despite the emotional and physical mayhem they were causing.]</li><li>Milgram: "It is the extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority that constitues the chief finding of the study." There are sobering implications of this finding for those concerned about the ability of another form of authority--government--to extract frightening levels of obedience from ordinary citizens.<br />[Self note: People say, "Listen to the experts/science!" these days. Blindly obedient.]<br />[Self note: I wonder how the test subjects in Milgram's experiments would respond if these were done in front of an audience or in public. They showed remorse in private, but would they defend their actions (see: consistency rule) if people knew about it? These days, people aren't remorseful when they blindly listen to authority and then authority turns out to be wrong. For example, in 2020 when the medical authorities went from saying we don't need masks to we do need masks. What percent of the population mocked those who did wear masks early on and then became hardcore maskers afterwards without any introspection? They just continued listening to the experts blindly.]</li><li>We are trained from  birth that obedience to proper authority is right and disobedience is wrong. The essential message fills the parental lessons, the school-house rhymes and is carried forward in the legal, military, and political systems we encounter as adults.<br />[Author note: If we didn't obey authority, we'd descend into anarchy, which is worse than our current civilzation]<br />[Author note: Compare the disobedience of Adam and Eve towards God early in the Bible, compared to Abraham and Isaac later on]</li><li>Conforming to the dictates of authority figures has always had genuine practical advantages for us. Early on, parents and teachers knew more than we did, and we found that taking their advice proved beneficial--partly because of their greater wisom and partly because they controlled our rewards and punishments. As adults, the same benefits persist for the same reasons, though the authority figures now appear as employesrs, judges, and government leaders. We often do so when it makes no sense at all. It is easy to allow ourselves the conveninece of automatic obedience. We don't have to to hink; therefore, we don't--because we are reacting rather than thinking.<br />[Self note: Always ask "why?"]<br />[Self note: Don't take their word for it. Always ask yourself if it makes sense to you. Do your homework, and be proactive, not reactive.]</li><li>Connotation, not content (CNC): The appearance of authority (without having an actual authority figure) is enough. Con artists, for example, drape themselves with titles, clothes, and trappings of authority. They introduce themselves as Doctor or Judge or Professor or Commissioner Someone. Each of these types is worth a look.</li><li>Titles: Titles are simultaneously the most difficult and the easiest symbols of authority to acquire. To earn one normally takes years of work and achievement. Yet it is possible for somebody who has put in none of this effort to adopt the mere label and receive a kind of automatic deference.<br />[Self note: Even people who have legitimate degrees can be con artists. Look out for those who flaunt their diplomas and tell you to listen to them without question.]</li><li>Titles: The connection between status and perceived size shows up in a variety of ways [those with status are perceived as taller by others]. Note it is not necessarily pleasantness of a thing that makes it seem bigger to us, it is importance. Because we see size and status as related, it is possible for certain individuals to benefit by substituting the former for the latter. In some animal socieites, where the status of a male is assigned on the basis of dominance, size is an import factor in determining which male will achieve which status level in the group. To avoid the harmful effects to the group of physical conflict, many species have adopted methods that frequently involve more form that fracas. Various mammals arch their backs and bristle their coats; fish extend their fins and puff themselves up with water; birds unfurl and flutter their wings. Very often, this exhibition alone is enough to send one of the histrionic warriors into retreat. [...] Fins, furs, and feathers. Isn't it interesting how these most delicate of parts can be exploited to give the impression of substance and weight? The connection of size and status can be profitably employed by individuals who are able to fake the first to gain the appearance of the second. Also, outward signs of power and authority frequently may be counterfeited with the flimsiest of materials.</li><li>Clothes: Though more tangible than a title, the cloak of authority is every bit as fakable. Con artists can adopt the hospital white, priestly black, army green, or police blue that the situation requires for maximum advantage.<br />[Author's note: Also beware of business suits]</li><li>Trappings: Aside from its function in uniforms, clothing can symbolize a more generalized type of authority when it serves an ornamental purpose. Finely styled and expensive clothes carry an aura of status and position, as do trappings such as jewelry and cars.</li><li>How to say no: One protective tactic we can use against authority status is to remove its element of surprise. We are at the disadvantage of being insufficiently cautious about its presence in compliance situations. A fundamental form of defense, therefore, is a heightened awareness of authority power.</li><li>Posing two questions to ourselves can help enormously when figuring out whether or not to listen to the authority figures. First, when we are confronted with what appears to be an authority figure's influence attempt, "Is this authority truly an expert?" The question is helpful because it focuses our attention on a pair of crucial pieces of information: the authority's credentials and the relevance of those credentials to the topic at hand. If we are confronted with an authority we determine is a relevant expert, we should ask "How truthful can we expect the expert to be here?"</li><li>Rule 7: Scarcity</li><li>The idea of potential loss plays a large role in human decision making. In fact, people seem to be more motivated by the thought of losing something than by the thought of gaining something of equal value.</li><li>Probably the most straightforward use of the scarcity principle occurs in the "limited-number" tactic, when the customer is informed that a certain product is in short supply that cannot be guaranteed to last long.</li><li>Related to the limited-number technique is the "deadline" tactic, in which some official time limit is placed on the customer's opportunity to get what the compliance professional is offering. People frequently find themselves doing what they wouldn't particularly care to do simply because the time to do so is shrinking.<br />[Self note: This is what a lot of self-help gurus do. They create an artificial scarcity and say that "We're offering a deal to the next 20 people who sign up/for the next 60 minutes. Only the most motivated people will sign up!". In reality, it's a class, so there's no scarcity at all, but many of them make lots of money.]</li><li>A variant of the deadline tactic is much favored by some face-to-face, high-pressure sellers because it carries the purest form of decision deadline: right now. Customers are often told that unless they make an immediate decision to buy, they will have to purchase the item at a higher price or they will be unable to purchase it at all.<br />[Self note: Always say NO to these people when they won't let you think about a decision. It's always a trap!]</li><li>The weakness is an enlightened one. Because we know that the things that are difficult to possess are typically better than those that are easy to possess, we can often use an item's availability to help us and correctly decide on its quality. By following it, we are usually and efficiently right. In addition, as opportunities become less available, we lose freedoms; and we hate to lose the freedoms we already have (called the "reactance principle").</li><li>The reactance principle is typical of individuals who have lost an established freedom and is crucial to an understanding of how psychological reactance and scarcity work on us. When our freedom to have something is limited, the item becomes less available, and we experience an increased desire for it. However, we rarely recognize that psychological reactance has caused us to want the item more; all we know is that we want it.<br />[Author note: Examples of the reactance principle include fussy two-year-olds ("terrible twos") and teenagers rebelling against their strict parents]</li><li>The intriguing thing about the effects of censoring information is not that audience members want to have the information more than they did before; that seems natural. Rather, it is that they come to believe in the information more, even though they haven't received it. For example, when University of North Carolina students learned that a speech opposing coed dorms on campus would be banned, they became more opposed to the idea of coed dorms. Thus, without ever hearing the speech, they became more sympathetic to its argument.<br />[Self note: Still true today I wonder...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PSYPrE5LrQ]</li><li>The parent who grants privileges or enforces rules erratically invites rebelliousness by uniwttingly establishing freedoms for the child. The parent who only sometimes prohibits between-meal sweets may create for the child the freedom to have such snacks. At that point, enforcing the rule becomes a much more difficult and explosive matter because the child is no longer merely lacking a never-possessed right but is losing an established one. People see a thing as more desirable when it has recently become less available than when it has been scarce all along. We should not be surprised, then, when research shows that parents who enforce discipline inconsistently produce generally rebellious children.</li><li>The competition in the pursuit of limited resources is also important. Not only do we want the same item more when it is scarce, we want it most when we are in competition for it. Advertisers often try to exploit this tendency in us. In their ads, we learn that "popular demand" for an item is sogreat that we must "hurry to buy", or we see a crowd pressing against the dorrs of a store before the start of a sale.<br />[Self note: Examples are Black Friday, college admissions, and job interviews -- coincidence that these are zero sum games?]</li><li>How to say no: Part of the problem is that our typical reaction to scarcity hinders our ability to think. To warn ourselves, rather than relying on a considered, cognitive analysis of the entire situation, we might simply tune ourselves to the internal, visceral sweep for our warning. By learning to flag the experience of heightening arousal in a compliance situation, we can alert ourselves to the possibility of scarcity tactics there and to the need for caution.<br />[Author note: "You get caught up in the mania of the thing, the acceleration of it. Logic goes right out the window." -- Robert Wood, CBS TV's president]</li><li>The joy is not in experiencing a scarce commodity but in posessing it. It is important that we not confuse the two. Whenever we confront the scarcity pressures surrounding some item, we must also confront the question of what it is we want from the item. If the answer is that we want the thing for the social, economic, or psychological benefits of possessing something rare, then fine; scarcity pressures will give us a good indication of how much we would want to pay for it. But very often we don't want a thing purely for the sake of owning it. We want it, instead, for its utility value; we want to eat it or drink it or touch it or hear it or drive it or otherwise use it. In such cases it is vital to remember that scarce things do not taste or feel or sound or ride or work any better because of their limited availibility.<br />[Self note: "Wearing a $300 or $30 watch - they both tell the same time" -- Steve Jobs]</li>
