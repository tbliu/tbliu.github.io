            <ul>
            <li>[Caesar] wished to discuss business of state of the highest importance to [the Romans and Germans]. To this delegation Ariovistus replied: "If I wanted anything from Caesar, I should go to him; so if he wants anything of me, he must come to me."</li><li>Ariovistus said that it was the recognized custom of war for victors to rule the vanquished in any way they pleased, and that the Romans acted on this principle by governing their conquered subjects, not according to the dictates of any third party, but at their own discretion.</li><li>Some [Gauls] affirmed that on many occasions when they had met [the Germans] in battle, the very expression on their faces and the fierce glance of their eyes were more than they could endure. This gossip threw all ranks into a sudden panic [...] affecting even seasoned campaigners, including some centurions and cavalry officers. [...] Observing this state of affairs, Caesar summoned the centurions of every grade to a council, and began by severly reprimanding them for presuming to inquire or conjecture where he was leading them, or with what object.<br />Caesar improves his troops' morale by bringing up past examples of Roman victories against Spartacus's slave revolt and the Gallic tribes that defeated the Germans previously. He also says Ariovistus won, not because of his men's superior fighting ability, but because they fought the Gauls after the latter had already fought a long war, so the Romans should defeat the Germans easily.</li><li>Caesar placed each of his five generals ahead of a legion and detailed his quaestor to command the remaining legion, so that every soldier might know that there was a high officer in a position to observe the courage with which he conducted himself.</li><li>Caesar had everything to do at once - hoist the flag which was the signal for running to arms, recall the men from their work on the camp, fetch back those who had gone far afield in search of material for the rampart, form the battle line, address the men, and sound the trumpet signal for going into action. Much of this could not be done in the short time left available by the enemy's swift onset. But the situation was saved by two things - first, the knowledge and experience of the soldiers, whose training in earlier battles enabled them to decide for themselves what needed doing, without waiting to be told; secondly, the order which Caesar had issued to all his generals, not to leave the work, but to stay each with his own legion until the camp fortifications were completed. As the enemy was so close and advancing so swiftly, the generals did not wait for further orders but on their own responsibility took the measures they thought proper.</li><li>The battlefront was not formed according to the rules of military theory but as necessitated by the emergency and the sloping ground of the hillside. The legions were facing different ways and fighting separate actions, and thick hedges obstructed their view. The result was that Caesar could not fix upon definite points for stationing reserves or foresee what would be needed in each part of the field, and unity of command was impossible. In such adverse circumstances there were naturally ups and downs of fortune.</li><li>As the situation was critical and no reserves were available, Caesar snatched a shield from a soldier in the rear, made his way into the front line, addressed each centurion by name, and shouted encouragement to the rest of the troops, ordering them to push forward and open out their ranks, so that they could use their swords more easily. His coming gave them fresh heart and hope; each man wanted to do his best under the eyes of his commander-in-chief, however desparate the peril, and the enemy's assault was slowed down a little.</li><li>But the enemy [the Nervii], even in their desperate plight, showed such bravery that when their front ranks had fallen those immediately behind stood on their prostrate bodies to fight and when these too fell and the corpses were piled high, the survivors still kept hurling javlins as though from the top of a mound, and flung back the spears intercepted by their shields. Such courage accounted for the extraordinary feats they had performed already. Only heroes could have made light of crossing a wide river, clambering up the steep banks, and launching themselves on such a difficult position.<br />[This battle is called the Battle of the Sabis and resulted in the near destruction of the Nervii]<br />[Interesting that Caesar describes his enemy as "heroes".]</li><li>Most of the Veneti's strongholds were so situated on the ends of spits or headlands that it was impossible to approach them by land when the tide rushed in from the open sea, which happens regularly every twelve hours; and tehy were also difficult to reach by sea, because at low tide the ships would run aground on the shoals.</li><li>Neither [Decimus Brutus nor] the military tribunes and centurions in charge of the individual ships could decide what to do or what tactics to adopt [against the Veneti ships]. They knew that no injury could be inflicted on the enemy by ramming, and when they tried erecting turrets they found that they were still overtopped by the foreigners' lofty serns and were too low to make their missles carry properly, while the enemy's fell with great force. One device, however, that our men had prepared proved very useful--pointed hooks fixed into the ends of long poles, not unlike the grappling-hooks used in sieges. With these the halyards were grasped and pulled taut, and then snapped by rowing hard away. This of course brought the yards down, and since the Gallic ships depended wholly on their sails and rigging, when stripped of these they were at once immobilized. After that it was a soldier's battle, in which the Romans easily proved superior [...]<br />Caesar: Mitigating his opponents' advantages and maximizing his own.</li><li>But as the Romans still hesitated, chiefly on account of the depth of water, the man who carried the eagle of the 10th legion, after praying to the gods that his action might bring good luck to the legion, cried in a loud voice: "Jump down, comrades, unless you want to surrender our eagle to the enemy; I, at any rate mean to do my duty to my country and my general." With these words he leapt out of the ship and advanced towards the enemy with the eagle in his hands. At this the soldiers, exhorting each other not to submit to such a disgrace, jumped with one accord from the ship, and the men from the next ships, when tehy saw them, followed them and advanced against the enemy.<br />Alternate translation: "Leap, fellow soldiers, unless you wish to betray your eagle to the enemy; I at least will perform my duty to the Republic and my general."<br />Context: During the amphibious landing of Caesar's first invasion of Britain<br />See also: Cialdini's Psychology of Influence...Similar to the Asch Conformity test with presence of a partner?</li><li>Cassivellanunus [...] retained only some four thousand charioteers, with whom he watched our line of march. [...] If ever our cavalry incautiously ventured too far away in plundering and devastating the country, he would send all his charioteers out of the woods by well-known lanes and pathways and deliver very formimdable attacks, hoping by this means to make them afraid to go far afield. Caesar was thus compelled to keep the cavalry in touch with the column of infrantry and to let the enemy off with such devastation and burning as could be done under the protection of the legionaries - tired as they often were with marching.<br />Again, Caesar mitigates his opponents' advantages (speed of the chariots; knowledge of terrain) and maximizes his own (superior infantry).</li><li>The only way to make an end of the business, and exterminate this race of criminals, would have been to break up the army into a large number of detachments which could be sent out separately. But it was safer to keep the companies in their regular formation, according to the established practice of the Roman army, although this meant that they could not injure the Gauls in such country. Even so, any men who strayed apart from the main body were liable to be ambushed and surrounded by some of the bolder spirits among them. In these difficult circumstances the most careful precautions were taken; Caesar thought it better to let the enemy off comparatively lightly, in spite of the men's burning desire for revenge, than to punish them severely at the cost of serious loss to his own troops.<br />When to take caution vs when to take risks?</li><li>[The Gauls] were already preparing to execute this plan [of abandoning the town of Avaricum] the following night, when suddenly their wives came running out into the streets and in tears threw themselves at the men's feet.<br />"Do not abandon us," they begged, "and the children who are yours as much as ours, to a cruel enemy. We cannot fly with you because we have not the strength."<br />When they saw that their minds were made up--for men who stand in extreme peril are generally too scared to feel pity--they started shrieking and gesticulating to the Romans to warn them of the men's intention.</li><li>The next day [after the loss at the Battle of Gergovia] Caesar paraded the troops and reprimanded them for their rashness and impetuosity. They had decided for themselves, he said, to advance farther and attaack the town, neither halting when the retreat was sounded nor obeying the military tribunes and generals who tried to restrain them. He stressed the disadvantage of an unfavourable position, explaining the motives which had dictated his actions at Avaricum, when, although he had caught the enemy without their general or their cavalry, he preferred to sacrifice a certain victory rather than incur even light casualties by fighting on unfavourable ground.</li><li>"Much as I admire the heroism that you showed," [Caesar] went on, "in refusing to be daunted by a fortified camp, a high mountain, and a walled fortess, I cannot too strongly condemn your bad discipline and your presumption in thinking that you know better than your commander-in-chief how to win a victory or to foresee the results of an action. I want obedience and self-restraint from my soldiers, just as much as courage in the face of danger."<br />He concluded his speech with words of encouragement, telling the men not to be upset by a reverse which was due to their unfavourable position and not to the enemy's fighting quality.<br />The Battle of Gergovia was the only loss Caesar incurred against the Gauls.</li><li>[Vercingetorix] said that he would content himself with the infantry which he had in the previous compaign, and would not tempt fortune by fighting a pitched battle [with the Romans]. With his great cavalry strength it would be quite easy to prevent the Romans from getting corn and forage.<br />"All you ahve to do," he concluded, "is to destroy your corn crops without hesitation and burn your granaries, knowing that this sacrifice will make you free men for ever and rulers over others."</li><li>On being informed of [Gallic reinforcements coming to Alesia], Caesar started to construct more elaborate siege works. He dug a trench twenty feet wide, which, having perpendicular sides, was as broad at the bottom as at the top. The other works were kept some six hundred and fifty yards behind this trench, to protect them against surprise attacks; for as such a vast extent of ground had to be enclosed, and it was difficult to man the whole circuit, there would be a danger of the enemy's swooping down in force on the lines at night [...]</li><li>When these defences [the Roman siege works for the attack on Alesia] were completed, Caesar constructed a similar line of fortifications facing outwards instead of inwards. This line described a circuit of fourteen miles, running along the flattest ground that could be found, and its purpose was to hold off attacks from the outside, so that, even if Vercingentorix's cavalry assembled a very large force, the troops defending the siege works could not be surrounded.</li><li>Distributed as they were along lines of such length [between the two walls], the Romans found it difficult to meet simultaneous attacks in many different places. They were unnerved, too, by the shouts tehy could hear behind them as they fought, which indicated that their lives were not in their own hands but depended on the bravery of others. It is nearly always invisible dangers that are most terrifying.</li><li>When Caesar saw that his men were weakening and running short of weapons, he sent Labienus to their relief with six cohorts, telling him to remain on the defensive if possible; but if he could not hold the camp by any other means, he must withdraw some cohorts from their positions and counter-attack. Caesar himself visited other parts of the lines, urging the men to hold out: on that day, he said, on that very hour, depended the fruits of all their previous battles.</li><li>The besieged Gauls despaired at last of penetrating the huge fortifications in the plain and attempted to storm one of the steep ascents. Carrying there all the implements they had provided themselves with, they dislodged the dfenders of the towers with a hail of missiles, filled the trenches with earth and fascines, and tore down the palisade and breastwork with their hooks.<br />Caesar first sent some cohorts to the rescue under young Brutus, then others under the general Gaius Fabius; finally, as the struggle grew fiercer, he led up a fresh detachment in person. These troops renewed the fight and succeeded in repulsing the attack.<br />Caesar now started for the sector to which he had sent Labienus, taking four cohorts from the nearest redoubt, and ordering a part of the cavalry to follow him [...] Labienus, when he found that neither ramparts nor trenches could check the Gauls' furious onslaught, had fortunately been able to collect eleven cohorts from the nearest posts, and at this moment sent to tell Caesar that he considered the time for decisive action was at hand. Caesar put on speed to get there in time for the fight.</li>
