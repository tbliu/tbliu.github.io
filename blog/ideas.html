      <strong>Timed Code Sandboxes</strong>
      <p>
        There are a ton of cloud development platforms out there, like Gitpod, GitHub codespaces, Replit, etc. As far as I know, these are all geared towards helping existing team members collaborate.
      </p>
      <p>
        For contractors or work trials/technical assessments, I'd love to have a cloud development box with a pre-defined lifetime. As an admin, I'd be able to resume boxes, define environments, control specific file access, etc.

      <strong>Poker Mental Math Game</strong>  
      <p>
        A web or mobile app that generates random scenario at a Texas Hold 'em table and asks the user to compute their pot odds, equity, fold equity, etc. as well as make a final decision: Call, raise (and by how much), or fold. Since there is a mathematically optimal decision here, users are evaluated on if they get the correct answer and how quickly they get there. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The random generation can affect the number of players still in the hand, how far the round is (i.e. pre-flop, flop, turn, river), what cards is on the board, what cards the user has, and how much money is currently in the pot.

      <strong>Social Media App For Reconnecting With Acquaintances</strong>
      <p>
        One of the difficult things post-college (especially if you graduated during COVID) is maintaining relationships with people who you have good relationships with, but aren't <i>quite</i> your friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having an app that looks through your contacts and suggests people to reach out to with the Tinder swipe interface could be a good way to reduce the friction required to make plans and hang out. More concretely, the app would try to connect two (or more) people who haven't met up in a while. If they both say "yes", then the app would suggest meeting places, e.g. different restaurants or bars near them. The group would then swipe right on places they would be willing to meet at.

      <strong>Orb</strong>
      <p>
        A miniature version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_(venue)" target="_blank">Vegas Sphere</a>. User can upload fun gifs/videos/images onto the orb like a shaken snow globe or the Eye of Sauron.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that multi-modal language models are a thing, users can also ask it questions (<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pondering-my-orb" target="_blank">ponder the orb</a>), in a manner similar to what Humane and Rabbit are trying to do with the Ai Pin and the r1 respectively.

      <strong>Orchestra VR</strong> 
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/4813149252124417/" target="_blank">Maestro VR</a> is a game that lets you play as a conductor in an orchestra. But I think it would be fun to build a VR game that lets you play as one of the musicians or soloists. With full-color passthrough becoming better and better, you would be able to see the actual instrument you're playing while the rest of the picture you see remains the rest of the concert hall.

      <strong>Text-to-Speech Blog Readers</strong>
      <p>
        I save a lot of interesting links from blogs, HN, Wikipedia, etc. I'd like to use TTS software to convert these to small "audiobooks" that I can listen to while I work out, cook, etc. Having a way to save other interesting links from the article so that I go down rabbit-holes later would also be nice.
