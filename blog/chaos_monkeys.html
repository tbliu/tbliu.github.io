            <ul>
            <li>Any Zuck meeting around Ads required a bit of prechewing and spoon-feeding. The reason was simple: Ads were not something he cared about at the time, and I imagine he saw these meetings more as duty-bound drudgery than anything else.</li><li>The company's senior leadership had called on the Ads team to dream up something fast to revive the lagging fortunes of the enterprise. This being Facebook, the initiatives originated not at the senior levels of the company but rather at the lower: random engineers who had conceived of a bit of of cleverness, glib product managers who had managed to seduce a few people to their vision.</li><li>I had been hired as Facebook's first product manager for ads targeting, charged with converting Facebook's user data into money by whatever legal means available. This task had proved considerably more difficult than it sounds. For months, the targeting team and I had been testing and ingesting every piece of Facebook user data--posts, check-ins, shared links, friends, Likes--to see if it would improve the targeting and delivery of Facebook ads. Almost without exception, none of it increased monetization to a substantial degree. The miserable conclusion was that Facebook, though assumed to be a rich repository of user data, did not in fact have much commercially useful data at all.</li><li>"Why don't you just answer the question?" blurted Zuck, cutting me off.<br />Panic breeds focus.<br />"I don't think [using plugin data for ads] would move the needle much, given recent experience," I replied flatly.</li><li>"In the future there will be two types of jobs: people who tell computers what to do, and people who are told by computers what to do. Wall Street was merely the first inkling. The next place where this shift would be seen at whopping scale in terms of both money and technology was in Internet advertising. And after that, it would hit transportation (Uber), hostelry (Airbnb), food delivery (Instacart), and so on. To take the theory further, computation would no longer fill some hard gap in a human workflow process, such as the calculators used by accountants. Humans would fill the hard gaps in a purely computer workflow process, like Uber's drivers.</li><li>An incumbent in a market dominated by a few, with total information asymmetry, and the ability to make prices on the market rather than just take them, has little incentive to increase transparency.</li><li>Scott was sacked--just like that [after two decades at Goldman]. Scott quickly found a comparable role at another bank, but the irony of the security-seeking loyal employee getting the ax never left me.</li><li>In all my experience in both startups and large companies, including and especially at Facebook, I would always prefer--a hundred times prefer--being subject to the rigors of the market, the fickleness of luck, and the whims of users than to navigate the popularity-contest politics of a large company, surrounded by the mediocre duffers who've succeeded in life through nothing more than guile and appearances.</li><li>If you want to be a startup entrepreneur, get used to negotiating from positions of weakness.</li><li>It's not the rats who first abandon a sinking ship. It's the crew members who know how to swim.</li><li>In the same way that a trust fund just makes a drug addict's spiral more long lasting and painful, a cash-generating business that doesn't improve the product postpones the inevitable by floating the charade, all the while actually making failure more likely.<br />[Martinez says symptoms of a sinking ship are: None of the early employees or co-founders are left, a business that makes too much money and distracts from perfecting the actual product, having no actual clients for the product, and overly-loyal employees.]</li><li>The fastest way you can indicate your level of startup naivete to a VC (or to anybody in tech), is either by claiming your in "stealth" [...] or by forcing someone to sign a nondisclosure agreement before you even discuss it. You may as well tattoo LOSER on your forehead instead, to save everyone the trouble. [...] if your idea is any good, it won't get stolen, you'll have to jam  it down people's throats instead.</li><li>The classic sign of a shitty startup idea is that it requires at least two (or more!) miracles to succeed.<br />[0 miracles: Not a startup (just a regular business like laundry). Most successful companies have 1 miracle e.g. Airbnb convincing people to rent out spare rooms/houses]</li><li>In contemplating an earlier version of yourself, you'll realize that young and glorious you was in fact a total and complete fuckwit. An older you, going back and whispering in your young ear, would issue not praise and encouragement, but insults and dire warnings.</li><li>One of Mark Twain's more uplifting quotes maintains that small people always belittle your ambitions, while the great make you feel that you too can be great.</li><li>Like the masters of old buying servants off the ship, tech companies are required to spend nontrivial sums for foreign hires [on H-1B visas]. Many companies, particularly smaller startups, don't want the hassle, and hire only American citizens [...] Big companies are the real beneficiaries of this peonage system. Large but unexciting tech outfits like Oracle, Intel, Qualcomm, and IBM that have trouble recruiting the best American talent hire foreign engineers by the boatload. [...] It's a shit deal for the immigrant visa holders, but they put up with the five or so years of stultifying, exploitive labor as an admissions ticket to the tech First World. After that, they're free. Everyone abandons his or her place at the oar inside the Intel war galley immediately, but there's always someone waiting to take over.</li><li>Silicon Valley capitalism is very simple:<br />Investors are people with more money than time.<br />Employees are people with more time than money.<br />Entrepreneurs are simply the seductive go-betweens.<br />Startups are business experiments performed with other people's money.<br />Marketing is like sex: only losers pay for it.<br />Company culture is what goes without saying.<br />There are no real rules, only laws.<br />Success forgives all sins.<br />People who leak to you, leak about you.<br />Meritocracy is the propaganda we use the bless the charade.<br />Greed and vanity are the twin engines of bourgeois society.<br />Most managers are incompetent and maintain their jobs via inertia and politics.<br />Lawsuits are merely expensive feints in a well-scripted conflict narrative between corporate entities.<br />Capitalism is an amoral farce in which every player--investor, employee, entrepreneur, consumer--is complicit.</li><li>The real YC selling points were the following: access to the YC partners, access to the network of YC founders, a bankable patina of prestige, and Demo Day. [...] The real network effect, however, was this: With the pool of YC companies expanding every year, you could probably re-create 80 percent of the consumer and infrastructure technology used in our Internet-enabled age exclusively with Y Combinator companies. Whatever need you have, whether system-monitoring tools, mobile development, or even marketing tools, you could find a YC company to fill it. Given that you were one of the family, you could expect excellent service and a steep discount. You could also be sure that whatever you were building would receive preferential adoption by others in the YC network, providing you with an instant set of savvy and patient users, as well as impressive logos to feature in a pitch deck.</li><li>Despite all this techie fix-it boosterism, not every problem has an engineering solution. That doesn't mean, of course, that you can't sell one.</li><li>Most small startups decide to go after the small-to-medium-sized businesses (SMB) market because they think it's an easy mark. The enterprise sale is too hard, the sales cycle too long, and big companies too untrusting (perhaps reasonably so) of early0stage copanies. So they sell to that venerable couple, that mythical bedrock of American values so loved by politicians: Mom and Pop. While it's true that Mom and Pop are likely to try anything once, and that the quality of their typical software and service would make Italian phone companies look cutting edge by comparison, it is also true that Mom and Pop are phenomenally flaky, and are likely to cancel their subscription to even a useful service, making user turnover a problem.</li><li>[Author note: "Like marriage, but without the fucking" is a Paul Graham quote about startup founders and is probably the most memorable take on the nature of the cofounder relationship: it's like you're married, but with none of the good and most of the bad.]</li><li>[Regarding startup hierarchy:] As PG told us all: "Have a leader!" Accept that he or she is a dictator. Don't like it? Think you can make a better captain? Then get the fuck out and find your own startup ship to run.<br />[Only one top dog...can't structure things equally or big decisions will never be made.]</li><li>People go into startups thinking that the technical problems are the challenges. In practice, the technical stuff is easy, unless you're incompetent or really at the hairy edge of human knowledge. [...] No, every real problem in startups is a people problem, and as such they're the hardest to solve, as they often don't have a real solution, much less a ready software fix. Startups are experiments in group psychology. As CEO, you're both the therapist leader, and the patient most in need of therapy.</li><li>There's a Jewish folklore about a biblical king who dispatches one of his wise men to craft him a mantra that would both humble the proud and console the unfortunate. After searching in the market, where our wise man consults a local jeweler, he returns to the king with an engraved ring. The king holds the ring close and reads: "This too shall pass". So remember that, when lamenting your troubles, contemplating the perceived triumphs of peers and competitors, or rejoicing in that rare entrepreneurial triumph. It will all soon pass, and much faster than you think.</li><li>Startups are business experiments performed with other people's money. [...] The first money in is known as the seed round. Historically, this money came from the proverbial friends and family, or from angels like Russ, or from pseudoangels like Chris Sacca. Companies are are funded via a mix of debt and equity. In the startup world the first money in is usually in debt form, which is counterintuitive, and also deceptive, as it's not really debt that is paid off.<br />[Note: Convertible notes are now replaced by SAFEs]</li><li>All early-stage companies, except those that raise an exceptionally large round of funding from the get-go, raise on what's called a convertible note.  Despite the fancy name, it's essentially debt with a nominal interest rate. Should the company be acquired or raise yet more money, this note converts into equity in the company, such that you became an actual owner rather than a creditor.</li><li>From the point of view of the investor, this is actually problematic. Say you're the hot startup of the moment in the midst of a bubble, and you raise on some crazy valuation, such as $100 million. Well pity our poor angel investor; he gets only 0.1 percent of the company. In essence, the better the company does, the less of it he gets. While he's guaranteed in theory to get a price per share equal to follow-on investors, that's actually a gross mispricing of his risk, as he put his money in far earlier, when the company was far riskier.</li><li>Enter the investor's great friend: the cap. The cap dictates the maximum number at which the company will be valued, for the purposes of calculating the investor's stake when the company takes more investment capital. If the initial $100,000 investment had been done at a cap of $3 million, then despite the company's raising later at a valuation of $10 million, the angel's stake amounts to $100,000 / $3 million = 3.3%, a much bigger slice.</li><li>A capped note is like having to seduce five women one after the other, while the quity round is having to convince five women to do a sixsome with you. The latter is exponentially harder than the former.<br />[Note: Analogy was for funding companies via debt vs equity]</li><li>In VC, as often in life, it's the incompetent and insecure who are generally the assholes; teh masterful and successful--not to mention those universally perceived as the best in their field--are playing the long game. You never know where the next Airbnb is coming from.</li><li>There are various flowery titles that the VC set adorn themselves with: "associate," "principal," "analyst,", "partner," "operating partner," "managing partner," general partner," and so forth. [...] One quick way to cut through the shit: ask your pretender-to-influence, "Do you have decision-making power?" If he or she even remotely hesitates or hedges, you're speaking to a lackey. His or her only utility is to get you to the person who does have that power [...] So route around such people if a real investment check is your goal. Arguably (and this is the canonical YC advice) don't even accept a meeting from someone who can't answer yes honestly to the above question. You're wasting your time.</li><li>With VCs the yesses are usually immediate, while the nos are typically slow to arrive, if they arrive at all. If the partners reacted warmly at Monday's meeting, we'd get a call or email that very evening. If they didn't...well, he'd get to writing us an email at some point during the week, and all we could do is wait.</li><li>The lifelong Machiavelli fan in me remembered that memorable line from "The Prince": war is never avoided; it's only postponed to someone's advantage.</li><li>As Sun Tzu informs us, no matter how cowardly by nature, anyone fights to the death when his back is against the wall. A wise combatant always allows his opponent a way out [...] Faced with no choice, even the skittish boys would fight to the end, particularly if the actual cost of the fighting, if not the risk of losing, had been passed on to others.</li><li>Here is a key insight for any startup: You may think yourself a puny midget among giants when you stride out into a marketplace, and suddenly confront such a giant via litigation or direct competition. But the reality is that larger companies often have much more to fear from you than you from them. For starters, their will to fight is less than yours. Their employees are mercenaries who don't deeply care, and suffer from the diffuse responsibility and weak emotional investment of a larger organization. What's an existential struggle to you is merely one more set of tasks to a tuned-out engineer bored of his own product, or another legal hassle to an already overworked legal counsel thinking more about her next stock-vesting date than your suit.</li><li>Also, large companies have valuable public brands they must delicately preserve, and which can be assailed by even small companies such as yours, particularly in a tight-knight, appearances-conscious ecosystem like that of Silicon Valley. America still loves an underdog, and you'll be surprised at how many allies come out of the woodwork when some obnoxious incumbent is challenged by a scrappy startup with a convincing story.</li><li>So long as you maintain unit cohesion and a shared sense of purpose, and have the basic rudiments of living, you will outlast, outfight, and out-rage any company that sets out to destroy you. Men with nothing to lose will stop at nothing to win.</li><li>If you're going to be an egomaniacal, sociopathic prick, then do it properly and murder your enemies outright, rather than throw them a bone and expect to kill them later if there is trouble. They might just turn that bone into a weapon.</li><li>There's a cliche in the Valley that doing a startup is like jumping off a cliff and building an airplane on the way down. How high the cliff is and how much time you have before death are a pure function of how much money you've raised.</li><li>To quote Balzac, "The secret of great fortunes without apparent cause is a forgotten crime, as the crime was properly done." [...] You'll have to trust me on this: The story of just about every early-stage startup is peppered with tales such as mine. Backroom deals negotiated via phone calls to leave no legal trace, behind-the-back betrayals of investors or cofounders, seductive duping of credulous employees so they work for essentially nothing. [...] In the end, success would forgive any sins, as it did for Gates and Jobs, and continues to do for countless startup entrepreneurs. Do we begrudge David the use of his sling, after all, against the towering giant Goliath?</li><li>There are two weak points for tech companies, no matter how large: their investors and their potential business partners. The former influence even obdurate company leaders both by personal sway and by the fact that they often occupy voting seats on the board. If the founders lack leverage at fund-raising time, the CEO will be outnumbered on the board, and he serves at the pleasure of voting board members. [...] The other weakness is potential business partners. Shipping new product is one thing, but deals are where the startup rubber hits the revenue road. If the product is enterprise software, as it was for Adchemy, that meant a handful of deals a year was the company's entire commercial livelihood. A few big contracts, and that's what sustained the long-term value. If these were partnerships rather than deasl [...] Then the stakes were even higher. Ugly realities like lawsuits would send the more powerful partner fleeing. Even larger companies with billions in capital fear public shaming and legal quagmires.</li><li>To have influence in the world, you need to be willing and able to reward your friends and punish your enemies.</li><li>Another brief lesson in startups: Whenever you face some stressful, time-consuming, and risky challenge, firewall the rest of the company away from the mess. They'll likely add no value, and the attendant uncertainty will corrode their productivity when you likely need it most. No matter what happens in the outside world--lawsuit, money issues, the fucking zombie apocalypse--do not let it infect the company's headspace and become the top item in the internal narrative.</li><li>What's it take to do startups? It certainly isn't intelligence. Most of the founders I know are certainly crafty and quick-witted, but they aren't going to win any Fields Medals or Nobels. It certainly isn't technical skill. Some founders are technical virtuosos, but I suspect most weren't the top students in their respective computer science classes (assuming they even had a formal education). It's not unique product or market vision. Some startup ideas were visionary, like Airbnb, but many, like Dropbox, were merely extremely well executed versions of existing technologies. In my experience, there are two traits that distinguish successful startup founders at whatever level of the game, from the forgettably miniscule to the epoch changing. First, the ability to monomaniaclly and obsessively focus on one thing and one thing only, at the expense of everything else in life. I lived breathed, and shat AdGrok. Thanks to focusing on AdGrok, I watched my daughter grow up through the frame of a Skype window while I was in AdGrok's Mountain View shit hole. I had no social life outside of schmooze-and-booze tech events, at which I would wear my AdGrok T-shirt and engage in techno small talk with people I dind't really care about. [...] Second, the ability to take and endure endless amounts of shit.  I scraped by on nothing for six years as a penniless grad student in an expensive city, and then survived three years on Wall Street's most competitive trading floor during its biggest market catastrophe.</li><li>Incidentally, it helps to have enemies. While love is a beautiful emotion, far more empires have been built, books written, wrongs righted, fights won, and amibitions realized out of vengeful desire to prove some critic wrong, or existential dread of some perceived enemy, than all the love in the world. Love is grand, but hate and fear last longer.</li><li>The tech press, even more so than the regular press, willingly covered only births, deaths, weddings, and bloody accidents: that is, a new funding round, a startup's collapse (the messier the better), acquisitions, or a nasty scandal. To parapharse Jon Bond: marketing is like sex; only the losers pay for it.</li><li>You've spent months and gambled you career on a product, and then after a bit of excitement, you realize what a misshapen and misbegotten piece of shit it really is. This is the crisis that kills 90 percent or more of startups that manage to survive the initial plagues of founder disagreements, failure to ship code, and failure to raise money.<br />[Author describes this as "The Trough of Sorrow"]</li><li>Walking into any meeting, you should know every goddamn thing there is to know about the other person; if you don't, you''re failing. "There is no knowledge that is not power," and that's especially true in terms of people. That means a combined Facebook-Twitter-LinkedIn stalk at least. You should have done that on all the players in your space already, incidentally. Read between the lines of their idealized and cosmetically enhanced CVs: less than a year at a company means they didn't vest their first year of equity, which means either they or the company sucked, possibly both. Leaving at precisely four years means they're plodders, punching the equivalent of the white-collar Silicon Valley clock until the next shift. What friends or connections do you have in common? Do they know your dipshit douche friends you maintain for career reasons, or the ones you actually respect? Men are judged by the company they keep. Where do they hang out? Cheap tastes or expensive? Do they have that lean and hungry look and eat at dingy taquerias, or perhaps live off cheap staples like ramen or food substitutes? Those are the truly dangerous ones, the ones who live like organized crime trigger men, guerrilla fighters, or sailers at sea--who couldn't give a damn about quality of life. Those are the people to fear, because they don't need anything an antagonist can deprive them of.</li><li>Total commitment, like unconditional love, is the only type that matters. The bike-riding, date-night-going types will never give everything to a company or an idea, and arenothing morethan complacent bourgeois, whatever trappings of the "disruptive innovator" they may sport, often in the form of ponderous blog posts or a bookshelf of bound B-school-level bloviation. The ones who could pass for a homeless person, though, those are the startup kamikazes who will give everything for the etnrepreneurial cause, and are stopped only by death or jail.</li><li>When [an acquisition deal] really gets under way, there are always two channels of communication at work: One, a formal one, typically features email and attached documents, from founders to a company's corp dev deam, as well as a possibly relevant product team. The second is the informal and clandestine. For lack of a better word, let's call it scheming.</li><li>Such scheming happens either by phone or in person, with no emails or messaging involved. As a legal note, it's against the law to record phone calls in California, and such recordings are generally inadmissible in court, save for criminal trials with a warrant. So when the scheming begins, a startup world that does 99.9 percent of its communication via the asynchronous channels of email, messaging, and social media suddenly goes old school, and every cmmunication is conducted via hushed phone call in a closed-door conference room, that's when you can tell you're in some juicy shit; conversely; if you're still emailing about it, there's actually nothing real going on.</li><li>A local startup like Airbnb takes off, and real estate values in Barcelona and Berlin get roiled. The two-centruy-old bourgeois fortunes of those cities, having survived both Generalisimo Franco and teh US Army Air Force Bomber Command ,get kicked around by a bunch of scheming geeks and designers housed in an expensively renovated former factory. If a local app like Uber makes it big, taxi drivers in Paris and Mexico City will be rioting and sending bricks through cars' windsheilds. If Uber wins, Madrid taxi drivers' wives will be weeping and wondering what's for dinner. This was the major-league, serious shit, take-no-prisoners schampionship of tech entrepreneurship, and if you were going to play, you'd better show up ready to bite the ass off of a bear.</li><li>"Is it a reasonable thine, I ask you, for a grown man to run about and hit a ball? Poker's the only game fit for a grown man. Then your hand is against every man and every man's hand is against yours. Team-work? Who ever make a fortune by team-work? There's only one way to make a fortune and that's to down the fellow who's up against you." -- W. Somerset Maugham, "Straight Flush"</li><li>Assuming the company really wanted us, it would put a term sheet on the table. Right next to that would be a no-shop contract, which would mean any real selling of the company was done. A no-shop is either a separate contract or a clause in the term sheet stipulating that the company cannot solicit other acquirers during the period of negotiation and due diligence. Usually slotted for sixty days, they're enforceable in court, and some even carry penalties. The point is to put the company's self-pimping efforts on pause while the two parties get down to the serious business of haggling.</li><li>The risk expectations of founders nad investors can often be severely misaligned. Most VCs are playing a version of baseball in which the only way to score is to hit a home run when you're at bat. They don't care if you disgrace or impoverish yourself and strike out, and they don't care if you get a solid line drive that lands you on second. To them, strikeouts and getting on base are equally pointless, and so they'll push to proverbially "swing for the fences" no matter the count or the team you're up against. The reason for this all-or-nothing approach is how their funds are structured. VCs raise a fund, out of which they'll provision some number of investments. Barring doubling down on the same company, which they might do if the fund still has money when a company raises again, those investments are effectively "fire and forget". The fund's total profit will be calculated from whatever those initial bets return. Unlike, say, a hedge fund portfolio manager, who rolls the winnings from one good bet into the next, compounding a series of returns into something truly huge, VCs do not take liquidity from one company's exit and pour it into yet another's. This is why the go-big-or-go-home strategy makes the Silicon Valley world turn, and why tntrepreneurs push themselves to be either the next Airbnb, or nothing. The entrepreneur who bucks this and creates a long-term business of recurring revenue but relatively slow growth is dismissed as running a mere "lifestyle business," which is a dirty word among VCs.Of course, the entrepreneuers are quite happy to run a revenue-generating concern that spits out cash as low-tax dividends, and dedicate their lives to skiing or guiar playing or whatever. But their investors will hate them for it, and the entrepreneurs will suffer a loss of social capital as a result, and perhaps can't raise money for their next venture.</li><li>When you get the interview-day invite from whatever admin is managing the logistics, make sure to ask for the interviewer list the day before, so you can do the good librarian's son homework you should be doing, which is stalking each and every interviewer.</li><li>My situation wasn't unusual, though not generally talked about. Companies with acquisition wherewithal and the nerve to use it bid for what they wanted in deals. You came in with your team and your product; they gave it the once-over, and said, "We want person A and B, but not C, and we don't care about the tech." They then offered you a lump sum for what they wanted, and you were left to double-deal, buy out, or otherwise fuck over whoever in order to get the deal done. The company--and places like Facebook and Google did this commonly--cared only about net price pere engineer (or product person), not the absolute cost. And they certainly didn't care what investors got. Many an early-stage acquisition unfolded in this vulturelike way.</li><li>As every new arrival in California comes to learn, that superficially sunny "Hi!" they get from everybody is really, "Fuck you, I don't care." It cuts both ways though. They won't hold it against you if you're a no-show at their wedding, and they'll step right over a homeless person on their way to a mindfulness yoga class. [...] Ultimately, the Valley attitude is an empowered anomie turbocharged by selfishness, respecting some nominal "fell-good" principals of progress or collective technological striving, but in truth pursuing a continual self-development refracted through the capalist prism: hippies with a capitalization table and a vesting schedule. What would the Valley make of my betrayal then? How much was I sacrificing by making it? The capatalist hippies would take me back, I reckoned, I just had to be minimally successful. THe Land of the Stateless Machines would continue crunching away, ingesting people and money, and outputting products, and they'd still be happy to grind me into the mix as well.</li><li>"Faster, faster, faster until the thrill of speed overcomes the fear of death." -- Hunter S. Thompson</li><li>The acquiring company doesn't care less how money is divided between investors and employees. What they care about is price per hihg-value person (that is, engineers and product managers). If that works out, and the form of payment is whatever admixture of cash versus equity they prefer, the deal looks fine to them. Every acquiring company will have suc ha target price per person in mind when you seriously discuss a deal. Your job as deal negotiator is to get as close to that as humanly possible. The founders, however, have a more subtle view. A deal this small is likely not life-changing, fuck-you money. After you've rested and vested at the acquiring company, you'll likely wade into the startup fray again, need to raise money, and again live in the startup ecosystem. Screw your investors and word will get around. Also you may have a legitimate emotional bond with your investors. After all, they often stood by you when nobody elser did and potentially helped get the company sold. Thus, founders face a moral choice that's quite ticklish. They can opt to reward their investors for their investments in time and money, but they're essentailly paying them out of their wallet. The deal is very much a zero-sum game between founders and investors in the final stages.</li><li>Running game on your investors or your acquirers is just life in the big city, but bluffing out your cofounders, those same guys who sweated through the lows and the highs with you, is a step too far out on the prick spectrum.</li><li>Every founder owns something like 20 to 40 percent of the company. That's as much as or more than what would be sold in a fund-raising round. If every founder owned that stake from day one, they would all essentially hold a gun to the company's temple. If any founder decided to leave following an argument (or was forced by his cofounders to resign), he'd kill the company, as no investor would fund a company in which an equivalent stake to his or hers was held by some disgruntled outsider. And so even founders in a well-established company are on a vesting schedule, and get only a quarter of their fat equity slice after a year, just as a big-company CEO does.</li><li>Here's where the genius in the on-boarding, and more broadly in Facebook, really lay. People joined Facebook, and like immigrants at Ellis Island, left their old, dated cultures behind, replaceing them with an all-consuming new on.e The on-boarding experience was designed precisely as the sort of citizenship oath that new Americans took in front of a flag and a public official. It was almost religious, and taken absolutely sincerely and at face value. Even in a culture brimming with irreverent disdain, I never heard anyone utter a word of cynical trollery about Facebook and its values, either at on-boarding or during my years of work there. As with Americans and "our troops", motherhood, and the Constitution, certain things were enshrined, and nobody dared ridicule them.</li><li>"We [Facebook] don't want to create a culture where someone is going to HR to complain every day. If someone says something, call them out on it. Hopefully it stops there, and you go on with your day."</li><li>Before 2013, if you wanted to know how Facebook made money, the answer was very simple: a billion times any number is still a big fucking number. Facebook monetization was laughable compared with Google's on a purely CPM basis. But usage was ungodly. Up there with heroin, carbohydrates, or a weekly paycheck: that's how addictive and rewarding Facebook was.</li><li>"By itself, genius can produce original thoughts just as little as a woman by herself can bear children. Outward circumstances must come to fructify genius, and be, as it were, a father to its progeny" -- Arthur Schopenhauer, "On Genius"</li><li>In general, be it at startups or aggressive companies like Facebook, there should be a cultural bias for launching. The perfect is very often the enemy of the good, and as the Facebook poster screamed from every wall: "Done is Better Than Perfect". Very few companies have died due to launching early; at worst, you'll have a onetime product embarrassment (as Apple did with the first version of its iPhone Maps app). However, countless companies have died by losing the nerve to ship, and freezing into a coma of second-guessing, hesitation, and internal indecision. As in life, so in business: maintain a bias for action over inaction.</li><li>Nobody thinks AT&T should be shut down when criminals use the phone system to commit a crime, or the US Postal Service regulated when a terrorist sends a bomb through the mail. But the average Facebook user considers the service to be some sort of frivolous toy, rather than a social utility on par with running water, and therefore thinks we can just shut it down if it seems to harbor any hint of criminality.</li><li>Facebook doesn't sell your data; it buys it. It does this by providing services to advertisers that incentivize them to let Facebook ingest the data you've generated outside Facebook. [...] If you stop for a moment and realize how suicidally stupid it would be for Facebook to hand over its data on users to anyone, for any amount of money, you'll realize how tired that "Facebook sells your data" meme is.</li><li>"Cognitive dissonance": The mental stress people suffer when presented with realities contrary to their deeply help beliefs. The key takeaway is that humans naturally avoid this discomfort, skirting situations that aggravate it, or ignoring data that make their mental contradiction apparent.</li><li>Facebook Ads products had to be forced down the throats of partners, who then forced them down the throats of advertisers. Since Facebook Ads didn't ship products that people actually asked for, launching always had a certain foie-gras-duck-undergoing-gavage quality to it: open up and pump it in.<br />[Author Note: The justification for this is an attitude best expressed in an apaocryphal quote usually credited to the automotive pioneer Henry Ford, and bandied about by would-be visionaries: "If I had asked what my customers wanted, they'd have said 'faster horses'". The idea here is that the truly prophetic product leader can figure out what users want, even if users themselves can't really conceptualize it.]</li><li>When it came to product marketing in tech, that old Fleet Street mantra was law: never let the facts get in the way of a good story.</li><li>The ecstatic throes of cultish product development resemble fog in more than one way. As with fog, when you're in the middle of it, you can't really see it. The fog obscures the farthest reaches of your vision, but everything in your vicinity looks normal. The true density of a fog bank can only be seen from a distance, at a remove. Nobody inside the Ads org--from Sheryl to the top Ads leadership, freshly poached from Google, to the line product managers like me--ever called bullshit on this utterly improbable business model.</li><li>"Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell." --Edward Abbey, "The Journey Home"</li><li>In time, monetization will follow usage, as it always does. Money follow eyeballs, even if slowly. [...But] the key to understanding the somewhat tense Ads=Growth dialectic is this: What makes a user use the product does not necessarily make money, and the reverse is also true. In fact, they're anticorrelated in general, and you can drive engagement or make money, but not both at once.</li><li>What's the first thing every child learns? What's the first lesson we impart to a new pet? What makes us snap instantly out of any reverie, no matter how deep? A name. It's simple, but magical when you think about it: you way a special word, and the person (or dog, or infant) turns and directs his or her attention at you. Involuntary and yet so fundamental, it's practically the definition of self-awareness: I know who I am and will respond when called [...] Without our names, we wouldn't be us.</li><li>Modern advertising is just selective name-calling which is why it's so wonderfully primal. How is that? The only difference between the various marketing channels we think are so distinct the names we use to address the target audience. How advertising works is effectively a call-and-response of names, with some mechanisms being far more efficient than others. So what are those names?<br />[Author note: Name for direct mail is your mailing address. Name for your phone: Phone number. Laptop: The contents of the Facebook retargeting cookie]</li><li>The biggest thing going on in marketing right now, what is generating tens of billions of dollars in investment and endless scheming inside the bowels of Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple, is the puzzle of how to tie these different sets of names together, and who controls the links. That's it. Other than this "Game of Thrones" power struggle among the great digital powers to control identity, targeting, and attribution, everything else is a parsitic sideshow scarcely worth the hassle of following.</li><li>You consume; therefore you are.</li><li>All ambitious men want either to please their fathers or to punch them in the goddamned face.</li><li>There are only two inflection points in personal wealth, two points where your life really changes. One is the aforementioned "fuck you money", the other is the even loftier "fuck the world" money. Before that first run of fuck-you money, when you're counting your nickels and dimes and shares and bonuses and what all to get to a few hundered K of dosh, all that changes is what I'll call your indifference threshold to expense. If before you didn't think about dropping $6 for another pint of beer with your friends, now you don't think about the pricey $60 salmon luch at Anchor & Hope. If you previously thought before indulging yourself with some questionably useful $50 gadget, now you'll drop $500 on a new phone or ultracompact projector without thinking about it. [...] It's like your mental decimal point of concern has moved over a zero (or perhaps more than one). You're not even really thinking about costs until you've broken $1,000. This sliding around of an indifference threshold is peanuts in the scheme of things. Real transformation happens at the first rung of the wealth ladder. Fuck-you money is like reaching the break-even point in the startup of you, and it means you are no longer beholden to outside forces.</li><li>Here is your lesson from the Facebook IPO: whenever you see the headline "Stock X pops on First Day of Trading and Declared a Success," instead think "Founders and employees just got completely screwed, and the bankers and their wealthy clients made fortunes."</li><li>Like any large company, Facebook would always aim to create monopoly pricing power and maintain information asymmetry, rather than drive true innovation. If Facebook played with the outside world, it always played with loaded dice.</li><li>To be someone or to do something, which would I choose? A man ocasionally reaches a fork in life's path. One road leads to doing something, to making an impact on his organization and the world. To being true to his values and vision, and standing with the other men who've helped build that vision. He will have to trust himself when all men doubt him, and as a reward, he will have the scorn of his professional circle heaped on his head. He will not be favored by his superiors, nor win the polite praise of his conformist peers. But maybe, just maybe, he has the chance to be right, and create something of lasting value that will transcend the consensus mendiocrity inherit in any organization, even supposedly disruptive ones. The other road leads to being someone. He will receive the plum products, the facile praise afforded to the organization man who checks off the canonical list of petty virtues that define moral worth in his world. He will receive the applause of his peers, though it will be striking how rarely that traffic in official praise leads to actual products anybody remembers, much less advances the overall cause of the organization.</li><li>With acquisitions, it's not what you pay, it's what they cost you that matters. Facebook would have to feed and maintain a mountain of crap code (and the crappy boders who created it) for a long time to come. The amount of technical debt it had to pay down was evidently huge; the "new" Atlas would be dogged by delays and wouldn't launch for over two years.</li><li>What's it like to be a Gokul or a Boland or a Fischer? You've seen excellent engineers and product people come and go, as your recruiters land the best new grads from every leading school. Your privileged position inside a powerful and market-leading organization exposes you to every industry trend and player, and pads your network with a roster of power and influence. Your ability to make any company's senior management appear and deliver fawning and revealing product demos means you know everything that's going on in your industry, down to the color of the clickable buttons in your products. And yet here you are, lips bolted like pipe flanges onto some bigwig's ass, plodding along like an ox yoked to a grain mill, grinding the grist the big-company machine requires. Why is that? I'll tell you why. It's because you are without a doubt the least daring and least innovative person at your organization, because in the opportunity-rich environment in which you live, the ambitious and capable have left to pursue it. THere's a negative selection in which the cream (or whatever it is that initially rises) gets constantly skimmed off, and you are what's left after years of continual skimming. Changing from big company A to big company B is cosmetic, as it's of course at least a lateral move if not a step up. You learn that what matters in a big company is to avoid falling victim to firing or layoffs, and to appear important and critical to the company's mission. You have mastered the art of "managing up": namely, controlling the feelings and perceptions of the management layer above you. You take feedback well, and make sure to be seen speedily acting on that feedback. If you have reports, you champion their careers internally (make sure they know you're doing that), and try to mold them into people like yourself, who are organizationally effective and recognized as such. In all but the most patholigical organizations, your reports' success will reflect well on you and create your own success. You make sure to form allegiances and friendships with your peer managers, particularly in organizations like sales or business development that you'll need to push your business agenda forward. When there's an ineffective or incompetent member in the organiation, rather than calling them an idiot to their face and firing them if possible, you channel feedback to their manager and learn to work around their incompetence. If the incompetence does not directly affect you or your team, you look the other way and focus on the levers you do control. You're middle management: you're the necessary layer between the visionaries and risk-takers who created the organization, and the new acolytes of your religion for whom this is a job, and you are their first whiff of corporate culture and authority. If you're cleverer than most middle managers (e.g. Gokul), you'll work at building your personal brand in a way that both aguments your prestige and reflects well on the organization, all in a studiously self-effacing way that allays and concerns around thinking yourself a "star". Failing that, the logo on your business card is your strongest asset, and you need to bank as much on that as you can, right up to them oment you trade it for another (hopefully better) one.</li>
