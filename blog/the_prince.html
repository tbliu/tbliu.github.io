</h1>
            <ul>
            <li>Whenever the Romans took over a province, this was the policy they followed; they set out colonies, indulged the less powerful without increasing their strength, broke the powerful, and never allowed any strong foreigners to pick up a following in their lands.<br />[Self-note: Spanish conquest of Americas (no colonies) vs British conquest of Americas (colonies)]</li><li>All kingdoms of which we have any knowledge are governed in one of two ways: either by a single prince with everyone else as servants [hard to conquer, easy to hold]; or by a prince with the aid of barons, who hold that rank, not by the prince's grace, but by right of birth in an ancient family [easy to conquer, hard to hold].</li><li>When states are acquired which have got in the way of living at liberty and under their own laws, there are just three ways to hold onto them: the first is to destroy them; the second is to go there and live in person; and the third is to let them continue living under their own laws [...] the safest way with them is either to wipe them out or settle among them.</li><li>Armed prophets always win and unarmed prophets lose. [...] it is the nature of people to be fickle; to persuade them of something is easy, but to make them stand fast in that conviction is hard. Hence things must be arranged so that when they no longer believe they can be compelled to believe by force.</li><li>Men [who come to power by luck, like with gifts or by purchasing it] depend entirely on the good will and good fortune of those who raised them up, and these are two extremely volatile, unstable things. The new rulers do not know how to hold what they have been given, and they could not do it if they did know.<br />[Self-note: Nepotism?]</li><li>Anyone who thinks that recent benefits make great people forget old injuries is simply deluding himself.</li><li>When a prince takes a new state, he should calculate the sum of all the injuries he will have to do, and do them all at once, so as not to have to do new ones every day; simply by not repeating them, he will be able to reassure people, and win them over to his side with benefits.</li><li>A prince should live with his subjects on such terms that no accident, whether favorable or unfavorable, can force him to change his conduct. When misfortune strikes, harsh measures are too late, and the good things you do are not counted to your credit because you seem to have acted under compulsion, and no one will thank you for that.</li><li>Noblemen can be seen as essentially of two sorts: either they manage their affairs in such a way as to be entirely at your disposal, or they do not. Those who are devoted to you and who are not greedy, you should honor and cherish; those who are not devoted to you may again be seen in two ways. They may hold back from pusillanimity and innate lack of spirit; then you should make use of them, especially as counsellors, since in times of prosperity they will hold you in honor, and in times of adversity there is no need to fear them. But when they delibrately refuse to commit themselves for reasons of ambition, that is a clear sign they are thinking more of themselves than of you; and the prince should beware of men like this.</li><li>"The man who builds on the people builds his house on mud."</li><li>At crucial moments a prince always finds himself short of trustworthy men [...] And a crisis of this sort is particularly dangerous, as a prince never experiences it a second time. Thus a wise prince will think of ways to keep his citizens of every sort and under every circumstance dependent on the state and on him; and then they will always be trustworthy.</li><li>When you have mercenaries, their cowardice is most dangerous to you; when you have auxiliaries [e.g. armies of an ally], it is their courage you must fear.<br />[Summary: Be the master of your own troops. Mercenaries will abandon you because they only care about money. Auxiliaries will betray you because their loyalty belongs to someone else.]</li><li>Shortsighted men undertake policies for their immediate advantage, paying no heed to the slow poison hidden within them.</li><li>Being defenseless makes you contemptible [...] It is not reasonable to expect an armed man to obey one who is unarmed, nor an unarmed man to be safe among armed servants [...] there is no living together.</li><li>[A prince] must never idle away his days of peace, but vigorously make capital that will pay off in times of adversity; thus, when fortune changes, it will find him in a position to resist.</li><li>To be feared is much safer than to be loved [...] People are less concerned with offending a man who makes himself loved than one who makes himself feared: the reason is that love is a link of obligation which men, because they are rotten, will break any time they think doing so serves their advantage; but fear involves dread of punishment, from which they can never escape. Still, a prince should make himself feared in such a way that, even if he gets no love, he gets no hate either [...] this will be the result if only the prince will keep his hands off the property of his subjects or citizens, and off their women.</li><li>When [a prince] does have to shed blood [...] he should not [also] confiscated people's property , because men are quicker to forget the death of a father than the loss of a patrimony.</li><li>Since men love at their own inclination but can be made to fear at the inclination of the prince, a shrewd prince will lay his foundations on what is under his control, not on what is controlled by others. He should simply take pains not to be hated, as I said.</li><li>The prudent prince cannot and should not keep his word when to do so would go against his interest, or when the reasons that made him pledge it no longer apply [...] a prince will never lack for legitimate excuses to explain away his breaches of fath [...] but it is necessary in playing this part that you conceal it carefully; you must be a great liar and hypocrite. Men are so simple of mind, and so much dominated by their immediate needs, that a deceitful man will always find plenty who are ready to be deceived.</li><li>To preserve the state, [the prince] often has to do things against his word, against charity, against humanity, against religion. Thus he has to have a mind ready to shift as the winds of fortune and the varying cirumstances of life may dictate. [...] He should not depart from the good if he can hold to it, but he should be ready to enter on evil if he has to.<br />[Self note: Is the only conviction you should have to do whatever it takes to come out on top?]<br />[If you remain virtuous but lose your kingdom: "If the rule you followed brought you to this, then of what use was the rule?"]</li><li>[A prince] should appear all compassion, all honor, all humanity, all integrity, all religion. Nothing is more necessary than to seem to have this last virtue. [...] In the actions of all men, and especially of princes who are not subject to a court of appeal, we must always look to the end. Let a prince, therefore, win victories and uphold his state; his methods will always be considered worthy and everyone will praise them, because the masses are always impressed by the superficial appearance of things, and by the outcome of an enterprise.</li><li>And the world consists of nothing but the masses; the few have no influence when the many feel secure.</li><li>What makes a prince contemptible is being considered changeable, trifling, effiminate, cowardly, or indecisive [...] and make sure that his actions bespeak greatness, courage, seriousness of purpose, and strength. [...] he should be sure that his judgment once passed is irrevocable; indeed, he should maintain such a reputation that nobody will even dream of trying to trick or manage him.<br />[Self note: What's worse? A bad decision or no decision at all?]</li><li>[Publisher note: Machiavelli is declaring that moral qualities of a prince are virtues or vices only as they help or hinder his political functioning]</li><li>A prince will also be well thought of when he is a true friend or an honest enemy, that is, when, without any hedging, he takes a stand for one side and against another. It is always better to do this than to stand on one's neutrality; because if two of your powerful neighbors come to blows, they are either such people that you have to fear the winner, or they are not.</li><li>As a general thing, anyone who is not your friend will advise neutrality, while anyone who is your friend will ask you to join him, weapon in hand [...] even if this ally wins and becomes so powerful that you are at his mercy, still he owes you something, he is your friend. Men are never so dishonest that they will show gross ingratitude by turning immediately on their helpers.</li><li>There is no way to protect yourself from flattery except by letting men know that you will not be offended at being told the truth. But when anyone can tell you the truth, you will not have much respect. Hence a prudent prince should adopt a third course, bringing wise men into his council and giving them alone free license to speak the truth--and only those points where the prince asks for it, not others. But he should ask them about everything [...]</li><li>There is never any point in falling simply in the hope of finding somebody else to pick you up. Whether this comes to pass or not, it never makes for your own security, since it is a cowardly kind of defense that does not depend on your own efforts. The only good, safe, and dependable defenses are those that you control yourself with your own energy.</li>
