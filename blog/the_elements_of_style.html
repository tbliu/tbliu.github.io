            <ul>
            <li>Put statements in positive form. Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, colorless, hesitating, noncommittal language. Use the word not as a means of denial or in antithesis, never as a means of evasion.<br />He was not very often on time. | He usually came late.</li><li>Consciously or unconsciously, the reader is dissatisfied with being told only what is not; the reader wishes to be told what is. Hence, as a rule, it is better to express even a negative in positive form.<br />not honest               | dishonest<br />did not remember         | forgot<br />did not pay attention to | ignored</li><li>Placing negative and positive in opposition makes for a stronger structure.<br />Ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country.<br />Negative words other than not are usually strong.<br />Her loveliness I never knew / Until she smiled on me.</li><li>If your every sentence admits a doubt, your writing will lack authority. Save the auxiliaries 'would', 'should', 'could', 'may', 'might', and 'can' for situations involving real uncertainty.</li><li>The surest way to arouse and hold the reader's attention is by being specific, definite, and concrete.</li><li>Omit needless words.<br />there is no doubt but that | no doubt<br />used for fuel purposes     | used for fuel<br />he is a man who            | he<br />the reason why is that     | because</li><li>A writer may err by making sentences too compact and periodic. An occasional loose sentence prevents the style from becoming too formal and gives the reader a certain relief. Consequently, loose sentences are common in easy, unstudied writing. The danger is that there may be too many of them [...] using as connectives 'and', 'but', and, less frequently, 'who', 'which', 'when', 'where',  and 'while'.</li><li>Keep related words together.<br />He noticed a large stain in the rug that was right in the center | He noticed a large stain right in the center of the rug. [...]<br />The subject of a sentence and the principal verb should not, as a rule, be separated by a phrase or clause that can be transferred to the beginning.<br><br />A dog, if you fail to discipline him, becomes a household pest. | Unless disciplined, a dog becomes a household pest.</li><li>Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end.<br />The proper place in the sentence for the word or group of words that the writer desires to make most prominent is usually the end.<br />This steel is principally used for making razors, because of its hardness. | Because of its hardness, this steel is used principally for making razors.</li><li>Case. Often unnecessary.<br />In many cases, the rooms lacked air conditioning. | Many of the rooms lacked air conditioning.</li><li>Due to. Loosely used for 'through', 'because of', or 'owing to', in adverbial phrases.<br />He lost the first game due to carelessness | He lost the first game because of carelessness</li><li>Factor. A hackneyed word; the expressions of which it is a part of can usually be replaced by something more direct and idiomatic.<br />Air power is becoming an increasingly important factor in deciding battles. | Air power is playing a larger and larger part in deciding battles.</li><li>Farther. Further. The two words are commonly interchanged, but there is a distinction worth observing: 'farther' serves best as a distance word, 'further' as a time or quantity word. You chase a ball farther than the other fellow, you pursue a subject further.</li><li>However. Avoid starting a sentence with 'however' when the meaning is "nevertheless." The word usually serves better when not in first position.</li><li>Importantly. Avoid by rephrasing.<br />More importantly, he paid for the damages. | What's more, he paid for the damages.</li><li>-ize. Do not coin verbs by adding this tempting suffix. Many good and useful verbs do end in -ize: summarize, fraternize, harmonize, fertilize [...] Never tack -ize onto a noun to create a verb. [...] Why say "utilize" when there is the simple, unpretentious word "use"?</li>
