The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge

- So far as each individual is concerned all he can do is to take the abilities he has and make the most of them. His power over the past is gone. His power over the future depends on what he does with himself in the present. If he wishes to live and progress he must work.

- During early childhood the inspiration for anything like mental discipline comes almost entirely from the outside. It is supplied by the parents and teachers.

- Instead of seeking to direct me [on what to study], my father left me to decide. But when I had selected a course he was always solicitous to see that I diligently applied myself to it.

- In my own case the cost for a school year averaged about one hundred and fifty dollars, which was all paid by my father. Any money I earned he had me put in the savings bank, because he wished me to be informed of the value of money at interest. He thought money invested in that way led to a self-respecting independence that was one of the foundations of good character.
    - [Self note: Should parents pay for the children's things so they can save their own money for the future? Like transferring wealth without the government taxing it after death.]

- Much of [Amherst's] social life centered around the fraternities, and although they did not leave me without an invitation to join them it was not until senior year that an opportunity came to belong to one that I wished to accept. It has been my observation in life that, if one will only exercise the patience to wait, his wants are likely to be filled.

- It seems to be tru that unless men live right they die. Things are so ordered in this world that those who violate its law cannot escape the penalty. Nature is inexorable. If men do not follow the truth they cannot live.

- It seems as though good influences had always been coming into my life. Perhaps I have been more fortunate in that respect than others. But while I am not disposed to minimize the amount of evil in the world I am convinced that the good predominates and that it is constantly all about us, ready for our service if only we will accept it.
    - [Self note: Coolidge is a "glass half-full" guy. How do tragedies (bad things, but not necessarily evil) fit into his world-view? (He lost a son later in life.)]

- A sound mind in a sound body.

- The good [that came from daily religious worship] was infinite. Not the last of it was the discipline that resulted from having constantly to give some thought to things that young men would often prefer not to consider. If we did not have the privilege of doing what we wanted to do, we had the much greater privilege of doing what we ought to do. It broke down our selfishness, it conquered our resistance, it supplanted impulse, and finally it enthroned reason.

- In the development of every boy who is going to amount to anything there comes a time when he emerges from his immature ways and by the greater precision of his thought and action realizes that he has begun to find himself. Such a translation finally came to me. It was not accidental but the result of hard work. If I had permitted my failures, or what seemed to me at the time a lack of success, to discourage me I cannot see any way in which I would ever have made progress. If we keep our faith in ourselves, and what is even more important, keep our faith in regular and persistent application to hard work, we need not worry about the outcome.
    - [Self note: Reminds me of the quote from East of Eden: "Men knew beyond doubt that they were valuable and potentially moral units -- because of this they could give God their own courage and dignity and then receive it back."

- Through a common Fatherhood we are all embraed in a common brotherhood. [...] The conclusions which followed from this position were logical and inescapable. It sets man off in a separate kingdom from all other creatures in the universe, and makes him a true son of God and a partaker of the Divine nature. This is the warrant for his freedom and the demonstration of his equality. It does not assume all are equal in degree but all are equal in kind. On that precept rests a foundation for democracy that cannot be shaken. It justifies faith in the people.

- In ethics [we learned that the] only hope of perfecting human relationship is in accordance with the law of service under which men are not so solicitous about what they shall get as they are about what they shall give. Yet people are entitled to the rewards of their industry. What the earn is theirs, no matter how small or how great. But the possession of property carries the obligation to use it in a larger service. For a man not to recognize the truth [...] is for him to be at war with his own nature, not commit suicide. That is why "the wages of sin is death." Unless we live rationally we perish, physically, mentally, spirtually.

- Work is the expression of intelligent action for a specified end. It is not industry, but idleness, that is degrading. All kinds of work from the most menial service to the most exalted station are alike honorable.  One of the earliest mandates laid on the human race was to subdue the earth. That meant work.

- The great distinguishing mark of all [Amherst's faculty] was that they were men of character. Their words carried conviction because we were compelled to believe in the men who uttered them. They had the power not merely to advise but literally to instruct their students.

- It is one thing to know how to get admitted to the Bar but quite another thing to know how to practice law. Those who attend a law school know how to pass the examinations, while those who study in an office know how to apply their knowledge to actual practice.

- If [young men]] would go along with events and have the courage and industry to hold to the main stream, without being washed ashore by the immaterial cross currents, they would some day be men of power. [...] We should guide ourselves by general principles and not get lost in particulars. That may sound like mysticism, but it is only the mysticism that envelopes every great truth. One of the great mysteries in the world is the success that lies in conscientious work.
    - [Self note: In the age of the internet, it's easy to get swept away by a cross current. Politics, pointless videos, etc.: How do you remain steadfast?]

- My progress had been slow and toilsome, with little about it that was brilliant, or spectacular, the result of persistent and painstaking work, which gave it a foundation that was solid.

- It appeared to me in January, 1914, that a spirit of radacilism prevailed which unless checked was likely to prove very destructive. It had been encouraged by the opposition and by a large faction of my own party [Republicans]. It consisted of the claim in general that in some way the government was to be blamed because everybody was not prosperous, because it was necessary to work for a living, and because our written constitutions, the legislatures, and the courts protected the rights of private owners especially in relation to large aggregations of property. [Many bills were introduced] to help the employee by impairing the property of the employer. [...] I believed this doctrine would soon destroy business and deprive them of a livelihood. What was needed was a restoration of confidence in our institutions and in each other, on which economic progress might rest.
    - [Self note: Seems relevant to today's political climate. Evidence in support of the Fourth Turning theory? Faith in institutions are low. Are we in the "unraveling" phase?]
    - [Self note: "restoration of confidence *in each other*". Reminds me again of the quote from "East of Eden" -- Men who could give God their courage and dignity and could expect to receive back have disappeared from the Earth.]

- "When a duty comes to us, with it a power comes to enable us to perform it."

- You never can tell what you can do until you try. [...] Surprisingly few men are lacking in capacity, but they fail because they are lacking in application. Either they never learn how to work, or, having learned, they are too indolent to apply themselves with the seriousness and the attention that is necessary to solve important problems. Any reward that is worth having only comes to the industrious. The success which is made in any walk of life is measured almost exactly by the amount of hard work that is put into it.

- It is a great advantage to a President, and a major source of safety to the country, for him to know that he is not a great man. When a man begins to feel that he is the only one who can lead in this republic, he is guilty of treason to the spirit of our institutions.

- [My father] placed in my hands an official report and told me that President Harding had just passed away. My wife and I at once dressed. Before leaving the room I knelt down and, with the same prayer with which I have since approached the altar of the church, asked God to bless the American people and give me power to serve them.

- I had [the oath of office] set up on the typewriter and the oath was administered by my father in his capacity as a notary public, an office he had held for a great many years. [...] No doubt there have been kings who have participated in the induction of their sons into their office, but in republics where the succession comes by an election I do not know of any other case in history where a father has administered to his son the qualifying oath of office which made him the chief magistrate of a nation. It seemed a simple and natural thing to do at the time, but I can now realize something of the dramatic force of the event.

- Though [economic relations] are necessarily predicated on order and peace, yet our people are so thoroughly law-abiding and our foreign relations are so happy that the problem of government action which is to carry its benefits into the homes of all the people becomes almost entirely confined to the realm of economics.
    - [Self note: Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (Government edition!): (Bottom) Order -> Peace -> Good Economic policies (Top). Need to take care of the bottom levels before you should start worrying about cutting taxes, removing business restrictions, etc.]

- Wealth comes from industry and from the hard experience of human toil. To dissipate it in waste and extravagance is disloyalty to humanity. This is by no means a doctrine of parsimony. Both men and nations should live in accordance with their means and devote their substance not only to productive industry, but to the creation of the various forms of beauty and the pursuit of culture which give adornments to the art of life.

- When I became President it was perfectly apparently that the key by which the way could be opened to national progress was constructive economy. Only by the use of that policy could the high rates of taxation, which were retarding our development and prosperity, be diminished, and the enormous burden of our public debt be reduced. [...] I have steadily and without ceasing pressed on in that direction. This policy has encouraged enterprise, made possible the highest rate of wages which has ever existed, returned large profits, brought to the homes of the people the greatest economic benefits they ever enjoyed, and given to the country as a whole an unexampled era of prosperity.

- I have often said that there was no cause for feeling disturbed at being misrepresented in the press. It would be only when they began to say things detrimental to me which were true that I should feel alarmed.
    - [Self note: Still true for politicans today?]

- Perhaps one of the reason I have been a target for so little abuse is because I have tried to refrain from abusing other people.
    - [Self note: "Play long-term games with long-term people" goes a long way. Politics is a long-term game and politicians and the media are long-term people.]

- The words of the President have an enormous weight and ought not be used indiscriminately. It would be exceedingly easy to set the country all by the ears and foment hatreds and jealousies, which, by destroying faith and confidence, would help nobody and harm everybody. The end would be the destruction of all progress. While every one knows that evils exist, there is yet sufficient good in the people to supply material for most of the comment that needs to be made.
    - [Self note: Calvin Coolidge is the anti-populist. For example, this comment (don't say reckless and crazy things), cutting taxes, reducing size of the government, etc.]
    - [Self note: Let cooler heads prevail. How would Coolidge have handled the Great Depression? How would he restore "faith and confidence"?]

- The only way I know to drive out evil from the country is by the constructive method of filling it with good. The country is better off tranquilly considering its blessings and merits, and earnestly striving to secure more of them, than it would be in nursing hostile bitterness about its deficiencies and faults.
    - [Self note: How did Coolidge do this? Did he just do nothing (besides give speeches trying to restore "faith and confidence")?]

- I have seen a great many attempts at political strategy [...] to encompass the destruction of this or that public man. I cannot now think of any that did not react with overwhelming force upon the perpetrators, sometimes destroying them and sometimes giving their proposed victim an opportunity to demonstrate his courage, strength, and soundness, which increased his standing with the people and raised him to higher office.

- There is only one form of political strategy which I have any confidence, and that is to try to do the right thing and sometimes be able to succeed.
    - [Self note: Don't pay attention to the noise around you; focus on what matters]

- My own participation [in my re-election campaign] was delayed by the death of my son Calvin, which occurred on the seventh of July. He was a boy of much promise, proficient in his studies, with a scholarly mind, who had just turned sixteen. He had a remarkable insight into things. The day I became President he had just started to work in a tobacco field. When one of his fellow laborers said to him, "If my father was President I would not work in a tobacco field," Calvin replied, "If my father were your father, you would."

- After [Calvin] was gone, some one sent us a letter he had written about the same time to a young man who had congratulated him on being the first boy in the land. To this he had replied that he had done nothing, and so did not merit the title, which should go to "some boy who had distinguished himself through his own actions."

- We do not know what might have happened to [Calvin] under other circumstances, but if I had not been President he would not have raised a blister on his toe, which resulted in blood poisoning, playing lawn tennis in the South Grounds. In his suffering he was asking me to make him well. I could not. When he went the power and the glory of the Presidency went with him.

- The ways of Providence are often beyond our understanding. It seemed to me that the world had need of the work that was probable [Calvin] could do. I do not know why such a price was exacted for occupying the White House.

- Sustained by the great outpouring of sympathy from all over the nation, my wife and I bowed to the Supreme Will and with such courage as we had went on in the discharge of our duties. In less than two years my father followed [Calvin]. At his advanced age he had overtaxed his strength receiving the thousands of visitors who went to my old home at Plymouth. It was all a great satisfaction to him and he would not have had it otherwise.

- When [my father's] doctors advised me that he could survive only a short time I started to visit him, but he sank to rest while I was on my way. For my personal contact with him during his last months I had to resort to the poor substitute of the telephone. When I reached home he was gone. It costs a great deal to be President.

- A great many presents come to the White House, which are all cherished, not so much for their instrinsic value as because they are tokens of esteem and affection. Almost everything that can be eaten comes. We always know what to do with that. But some of the pets that are offered us are more of a problem. I have a beautiful black-haired bear that was brought all the way from Mexico in a truck, and a pair of live lion cubs now grown up, and a small species of hippopatamus which came from South Africa.

- A president cannot, with success, constantly appeal to the country. After a time he will get no response. The people have their own affairs to look after and can not give much attention to what the Congress is doing. If he takes a position, and stands by it, ultimately it will be adopted.

- The supposition that no one should be appointed [to a federal position] who has had experience in the field which he is to supervise is extremely detrimental to public service. [...] A Federal Trade Commissioner can render much better service if he has had a legal practice which extended into large business transactions. The assertion of those who contend that persons accepting a government appointment would betray their trust in favor of former associates can be understood only on the supposition that those who make it feel that their own tenure of public office is for the purpose of benefiting themselves and their friends.

- Every one knows that where the treasure is, there will the heart be also. When a man has invested his personal interest and reputation in the conduct of a public office, if he goes wrong it will not be because of former relations, but because he is a bad man. The same interests that reached him would reach any bad man, irrespective of former life history. What we need in appointive positions is men of knowledge and experience who have sufficient character to resist temptations. If that standard is maintained, we need not be concerned about their former activities. If it is not maintained, all the restrictions on their past employment that can be conceived will be of no avail.
    - [Self note: What about revolving doors? Was it as bad then as it is now?]

- The public service would be improved if all vacancies were filled by simply appointing the best ability and character that can be found. That is what is done in private business. The adoption of any other course handicaps the government in all its operations.

- The president has to remember that he is dealing with two different minds. One is the mind of the country [...] Those who compose this mind wish to have the country propserous and are opposed to unjust taxation and public extravagance. At the same time they have a patriotic pride which moves them with so great a desire to see things well done that they are willing to pay for it [...] In general, they represent the public opinion of the land.

- But [the public is] unorganized, formless, and inarticulate. Against a compact and well drilled minority they do not appear to be very effective. They are nevertheless the great power in our government. I have constantly appealed to them and have seldom failed in enlisting their support. They are the court of last resort and their decisions are final.
    - [Self note: Coolidge is referring to the silent majority]

- [The public is the] indirect rather than the direct power. The immediate authority with which the President has to deal is vested in the political mind. In order to get things done he has to work through that agency. [...] It is a strange mixture of vanity and timidity, of an obsequious attitude at one time and a delusion of grandeur at another time, of the most selfish preferment combined with the most sacrificing patriotism. The political mind is the product of mne in public life who have been twice spoiled. They have been spoiled with praise and they have been spoiled with abuse. With them nothing is natural, everything is artificial.

- It is because in their hours of timidity the Congress becomes subservient to the importunities of organized minorities that the President comes more and more to stand as the champion of the rights of the whole country. Organizing such minorities has come to be a well-recognized industry at Washington. They are oftentimes led by persons of great ability, who display much skill in bringing their influences to bear on Congress. They have ways of securing newspaper publicity, deluging Senators and Representatives with petitions and overwhelming them with imprecautions that are oftentimes decisive in securing the passage of bills. While much of this legislation is not entirely bad, almost all of it is excessively expensive. If it were not for the rules of the House and the veto power of the President, within two years these activities would double the cost of the government.
    - [Self note: Once again, Coolidge is the anti-populist]
    - [Self note: Some things never change...politicians will also fold at the first hint of resistance/threats, which makes electing strong politicans (and especially a strong president) necessary.]

- The last twenty years have witnessed a decline in party spirit and a distinct weakening in party loyalty. While an independent attitude on the part of the citizen is not without a certain public advantage, yet it is necessary under our form of government to have political parties. Unless some one is a partisan, no one can be an independent.
    - [Self note: Some things do change. But maybe we will see people move closer to the middle again eventually.]

- It is difficult for men in high office to avoid the malady of self-delusion. They are always surrounded by worshipers. They are constantly, and for the most part sincerely, assured of their greatness. They live in an artificial atmosphere of adulation and exaltation which sooner or later impairs their judgment. They are in grave danger of becoming careless and arrogant.
